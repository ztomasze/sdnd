### proficiency

Basic proficiency means you are at neither a bonus nor a penalty.

Characters are usually proficient in all [[skills]] and in some subset of the available [[weapons]], [[armor]], and [[language|languages]].  Only some characters are proficient in [[spellcasting]].

### improved

Through certain [[talents]], your proficiency bonus in [[weapons]] and [[spellcasting]] can be improved, and you can greater benefit from [[armor]].

### expertise

Expertise grants you a **+4 bonus** to related [[check|checks]].  If your [[mastery]] bonus is greater than this, you can substitute your mastery bonus instead.  

Expertise is used for [[skills]] or [[background|backgrounds]]. 

Expertise does not stack.  For example, if both a skill and your background would grant you expertise on a roll, you only gain the bonus once.

### non-proficient

If you use a [[skills|skill]], [[weapons|weapon]], or [[armor]] without proficiency, you suffer a penalty.

If you lack proficiency in [[spellcasting]] or a [[language]], you cannot use that thing at all.

**Proficiency** indicates that you are sufficiently competent in a thing that you can attempt to use or do that thing without penalty.  

| Competency       | Benefit                                     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Expertise        | +4 or +6 to related rolls                   |
| Improved         | +1 or more to related rolls                 |
| Proficiency      | +0 bonus - Able to use without penalty      |
| (no proficiency) | -4 to related rolls or unable to use at all |
### non-proficient

If you use a [[skills|skill]], [[weapons|weapon]], or [[armor]] without proficiency, you suffer a -4 penalty.

If you lack proficiency in [[magic]] or a [[language]], you cannot use that thing at all.

### proficiency

Basic proficiency means you gain neither a bonus nor a penalty.

Characters are usually proficient in all [[skills]] and in some subset of the available [[weapons]], [[armor]], and [[language|languages]].  Only some characters are proficient in [[magic]] and spellcasting.

### improved

Through certain [[feat|feats]], your proficiency bonus in [[weapons]] and [[Cast|spellcasting]] can be improved, and you can gain a greater benefit from [[armor]].

### expertise

Expertise grants you a **+4 bonus** to related [[check|checks]].  This bonus increases to **+6** at level 6.  

Expertise is used for [[skills]], [[background|backgrounds]], [[knowledge]], and some [[intelligence]] benefits (profession, craft, and secondary skills). 

Expertise does not stack.  For example, if both a skill and your background would grant you expertise on a roll, you only gain the bonus once.

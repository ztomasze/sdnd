Some effects grant a creature **temporary hit points** **(temp hp)**.  Track these separately from your normal [[hit points]]. Any damage that would reduce your current hit points reduces any temp hp first. 

You cannot heal or restore lost temp hp. If a second effect grants you temporary hit points, they are not cumulative: choose one pool or the other to retain.

Any temporary hit points are lost at the end of a night's [[resting|rest]].

### hit die (HD)

Your [[class]] will determine the size of your **hit die (HD)**. The hit die for starting classes is either a d4, d6, or d8, but your hit die size can be increased through certain [[talents]].

### hit points (hp)

**Hit points** **(hp)** represent how much [[damage]] you can take.  If you are reduced to 0 hp, you may start [[dying]].

At level 1, you start with a number of hit points equal to the max value of your HD. Add CON and STR to this, but your minimum total is the max value of your HD.

> **Example**  
> A new [[wizard]] has a d4 HD, -2 STR, and +0 CON. While it initially looks like she would start with 4 - 2 + 0 = 2 hp, she will start with 4 hp, as that is the minimum for starting character with d4 HD.

> **Example**  
> A new [[fighter]] has d8 HD, +2 STR, +1 CON. He starts with 11 hp.

You can permanently lose hp, so it is possible to have fewer hit points that when you started.

### leveling up

Each time you level up, you gain another HD, so your number of HD will equal your level.  All of your HD are of the same size.

When you level up, roll all your HD and then add your CON + STR modifiers (once each):

* Replace your hit point maximum with the value rolled if it is greater;
* Otherwise, add 1 to your current HP max.

### recovery

You can recover hit points lost to damage through magic or [[resting]].

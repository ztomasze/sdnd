### hit die (HD)

Your [[class]] will determine the size of your **hit die (HD)**. The hit die for starting classes is either a d4, d6, or d8, but your hit die size can be increased through the [[Improved HD]] feat.

### hit points (hp)

**Hit points** **(hp)** represent how much [[damage]] you can take.  If you are reduced to 0 hp, you may start [[dying]].

At level 1, you start with a number of hit points equal to the max value of your HD. Add CON and STR to this, but your minimum total is the max value of your HD.

> **Example**  
> A new [[wizard]] has a d4 HD, -2 STR, and +0 CON. While it initially looks like she would start with 4 - 2 + 0 = 2 hp, she will start with 4 hp, as that is the minimum for a starting character with a d4 HD.

> **Example**  
> A new [[fighter]] has a d8 HD, +2 STR, +1 CON. He starts with 11 hp.

You can permanently lose hp, so it is possible to have a lower hit point capacity than you started with.

See also [[temporary hit points]].

### leveling up

When you level up, determine your new HD pool from the following table:

| Level  | d4     | d6     | d8     | d10     | d12     |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------- | ------- |
| **1**  | 4      | 6      | 8      | 10      | 12      |
| **2**  | 2d4    | 2d6    | 2d8    | 2d10    | 2d12    |
| **3**  | 3d4    | 3d6    | 3d8    | 3d10    | 3d12    |
| **4**  | 4d4    | 4d6    | 4d8    | 4d10    | 4d12    |
| **5**  | 5d4    | 5d6    | 5d8    | 5d10    | 5d12    |
| **6**  | 5d4+2  | 5d6+2  | 5d8+2  | 5d10+2  | 5d12+2  |
| **7**  | 5d4+4  | 5d6+4  | 5d8+4  | 5d10+4  | 5d12+4  |
| **8**  | 5d4+6  | 5d6+6  | 5d8+6  | 5d10+6  | 5d12+6  |
| **9**  | 5d4+8  | 5d6+8  | 5d8+8  | 5d10+8  | 5d12+8  |
| **10** | 5d4+10 | 5d6+10 | 5d8+10 | 5d10+10 | 5d12+10 |

Then:

1. Add 2 to your current HP max.
2. Roll your new HD pool and add your CON + STR modifiers (once each). Replace your hit point maximum with this value if it is greater.

### recovery

You can recover hit points lost to damage through magic or [[resting]].

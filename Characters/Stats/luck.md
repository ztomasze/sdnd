You can leverage **luck** to turn fate to your favor.  

You start with 3 luck points. 

You can spend a luck point to do one of the following:

- **Reroll:** Reroll any single die you just rolled and take the better result    
- **Take 10:** Replace the d20 you just just rolled for an [[check|ability check]] with a 10
- **Min/Max damage:** Minimize or maximize any single [[damage]] die that you just rolled or that is about to affect you. (In the case of an incoming area effect, this only reduces the damage for you.)
- Other meta-narrative uses as suggested or permitted by the GM

You recover spent luck points with the [[recover luck]] downtime activity. 

You might also earn luck through your adventures, such as by praying at a dungeon altar or receiving a blessing from a wild unicorn. In these cases, you can temporarily exceed the normal 3-point limit to have up to 4 luck points.

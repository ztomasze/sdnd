SD&D uses the classic array of 6 **abilities**:

| Ability          | Abbr | Represents                                                                                             |
| ---------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Strength**     | STR  | Muscle, brawn, and physical power                                                                      |
| **Dexterity**    | DEX  | Hand-eye coordination, agility, reflexes, and balance                                                  |
| **Constitution** | CON  | Health, durability, endurance, and stamina                                                             |
| **Intelligence** | INT  | Knowledge, learning, reasoning, and memory                                                             |
| **Wisdom**       | WIS  | Willpower, common sense, perception, and intuition                                                     |
| **Charisma**     | CHA  | Force of personality, persuasiveness, personal magnetism, ability to lead, and physical attractiveness |

### ability score

For player characters, the score for each ability is always limited to between 3 and 18. 

Monsters can have scores beyond this range (but abilities are rarely used for monsters).

### ability score generation

When creating a new character, choose one of these two methods:

##### roll
1. Roll 3d6 for each ability in order to produce its score  
2. You may then "flip" the character by subtracting each score you rolled from 21
3. If you lack any score that is 14+ at this point, you can start over.
4. You may then swap scores between abilities as desired. However, if you instead accept the ordering that fate has dealt you, gain +1 to a score of your choice.

##### array
Assign these scores to abilities as you choose: 15, 14, 12, 10, 10, 8.

### ability modifier

Each ability then has a modifier = (ability score - 10) / 2, round down.

| score | modifier |
| ----- | -------- |
| 18    | +4       |
| 17    | +3       |
| 16    | +3       |
| 15    | +2       |
| 14    | +2       |
| 13    | +1       |
| 12    | +1       |
| 11    | +0       |
| 10    | +0       |
| 9     | -1       |
| 8     | -1       |
| 7     | -2       |
| 6     | -2       |
| 5     | -3       |
| 4     | -3       |
| 3     | -4       |

Your [[intelligence|Intelligence]] score has a few additional effects.

### ability name  

* The full name of the ability (such as Constitution) refers to the score.  
* The abbreviation (such as CON) refers either to the ability generally or to the modifier specifically (such as when used in math or a [[check|roll]]).

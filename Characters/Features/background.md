Either choose or roll (d20) for a **background** to provide some additional color to your character's earlier life. 

You can tailor your background to be more specific.  The examples provided are a good starting point for this. If you flesh out those details with a descriptive paragraph or two, the GM might grant you an [[proficiency]] bonus on rolls related to your past experience.

Your character will know 2 or more **languages**. 

* Your [[ancestry]] will grant your two languages. Your [[class]] and [[skills]] may grant you more.
- If you have a positive INT modifier, you can use each +1 INT to purchase bonus languages known  at a cost of 1 per common language, 2 per uncommon language, or 3 per rare language.
- If your INT is -3 or lower, you are illiterate.

Languages come in three categories:

* **Common languages** are spoken by humanoids that regularly comprise or interact with civilization. 
* **Uncommon languages** are those of exclusive or secretive sects or of wilder, distant, or exotic races.  
* **Rare languages** are those of creatures that dwell on different planes.

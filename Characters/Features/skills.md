While characters are typically [[proficiency|proficient]] in all skills, some [[class|classes]] and [[feats]] will grant you skill [[proficiency#expertise|expertise]].

Expertise in a **skill** grants you:

- An [[proficiency#expertise|expertise]] bonus on ability rolls for tasks related to that skill. The example applications listed in the table below are illustrative and do not form a closed or exclusive list of all possible applications of a given skill.    
- A special benefit, as described below.
- Special gear (for some skills), which may be necessary to practice the skill.  These items do not take up equipment slots for you.

> **Design: Skills**  
> The set of skill domains is not meant to cover all situations.  For example, none of the skills apply consistently to riding a horse, tying a knot, or cooking a pie. Similarly, you might gain expertise on an ability check from another source, such as leveraging your background as a farmer to evaluate the health and disposition of a pig or your profession as a blacksmith to appraise a hunk of iron ore. When making a check, it’s best to start with the appropriate ability roll and then apply a bonus if a given skill (or other similar benefit) could be applied. 
> 
> Since players are [[proficiency|proficient]] in all skills, any skill can typically be used untrained, but the tasks more commonly undertaken by someone with training are usually at least Hard and often Very Hard. You may also need tools, regardless of your proficiency. For example, you can’t pick a lock or craft a disguise without something to work with, even if that’s only a stiff wire or soot, grease, and extra clothing.

> **Design: No Influence skill**  
> There is no Influence skill that grants expertise in such activities as persuasion, diplomacy, haggling, intimidation, or command.  This is because social interaction is one of the pillars of the RPG experience. When there is an entry like this on a character sheet, there is a strong temptation for players to say, "I try to convince him!" and then roll some dice, rather than elaborating on the arguments used. Additionally, it can lead to an adventuring party only allowing one or two character to do the talking because they have the highest skill bonus. 
> 
> If the GM feels like there is some uncertainty as to the outcome of a character's social manipulation, they can still ask for a CHA roll. This recognizes that some characters might be generally smoother at social interaction than others, but not in such an unbalancing way. Occasionally granting characters advantage due to a good argument or a common social standing with their audience means that everyone can still serve as the most effective face of the party at different times.

> **GM Tip: Playing with default skill proficiencies**  
> The default fantasy medieval setting of SD&D assumes characters have had enough exposure to all skills to be able to able to make a roll in any of them with [[proficiency]]. However, you could play around with this assumption.  For example, perhaps you have a steampunk city or kingdom where everyone has enough exposure to new technologies to have a proficiency in a Tech skill. However, being removed from the wilds of nature, any character from this kingdom does not gain proficiency in Survival.  Meanwhile, characters from the Veldt to the south gain Survival proficiency but not Tech. 
> 
> If a character makes a roll that falls in the domain of a skill but lacks that proficiency, they are at -4 to the roll.

> **GM Option: Half bonus**  
> Sometimes a particular task feels either at the fringe of a skill domain or falls cleanly between two domains. In this case, you can apply only half the expertise bonus from the most relevant skill domain(s).  If the character has expertise in both of the overlapping domains, they can apply their full bonus.  Some examples include:  
> - Animal Handling = Insight + Survival  
> - Streetwise = Insight + Thievery  
> - Tracking = Perception + Survival  
> - Securely binding a prisoner = Thievery / 2

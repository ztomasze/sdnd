This [[specialty]] grants you the ability to prepare herbal concoctions.

As an action, make an INT check to draw forth and use a concoction.

* S: You are able to apply the concoction to yourself or an adjacent ally
* F: Your action is wasted and you cannot make that concoction again until you complete a long rest
 
You can instead use your action to pass a produced concoction to an adjacent ally for them to use or apply later to a different recipient with their own action. Unused concoctions lose their potency at the end of the scene. 

The herbal supplies needed to make these concoctions take up no equipment slots for you.

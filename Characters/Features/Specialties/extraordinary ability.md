This [[specialty]] grants you three amazing but non-magical capabilities.

To represent your elite training, choose four spells of tier 0 or 1 to serve as different stunts that you can perform. One of these spells can be of tier 2 with some kind of limitation. The spell effects should be limited or reflavored to be subtle enough to have an extraordinary or supernatural explanation (subject to GM approval), and all of them may require some other limitation to activate.

Your "spellcasting" stat depends on the concept these spells represent. All of your stunts are DC11 to activate. Add your mastery to these rolls. On a failure, you cannot use that particular stunt again until you long rest.Â  There is no mishap on a critical failure.

Below are some examples.

##### Bardic Music (CHA)

* cutting words (Daze)
* inspire (Bless, but can't include myself)
* lullaby (Sleep)
* serenade (Charm Person)

All require singing or playing an instrument to produce.

##### Ninja Ki (DEX)

* catfall / deflect missile (Featherfall, but only self or missiles directed at me)
* deadly shuriken (Magic Missile, but deals non-magical damage)
* ki weapon (Magic Weapon, but has a duration of Day)
* master of shadows (Invisibility, can only activate while unseen or in darkness)

None of these can be activated while wearing armor.

##### Plague Doctor concoctions (INT)

* healing draught (Cure Wounds)
* soporific gas bomb (Sleep)
* poisonous blow dart (Ray of Sickness)
* ???

Need to draw an item from my belt to use each ability. These items to not take up an equipment slot for me.

Each **feat** grants you an additional capability or bonus. 

Characters gain feats through [[level advancement]] and from some [[ancestry|ancestries]] and [[class|classes]].  Every character starts with at least one feat.

There are some limitations on the feats you can take:

* Some feats are limited to only certain classes or require certain prerequisites.
* You cannot take the same feat more times than your current [[mastery]].
* You cannot take the same feat more than the **Max** times listed in the table below. 

> **Example**  
> A level 1 human fighter gets to choose 1 feat for being human and one being a level 1 character. However, that fighter cannot take Improved Armor twice (once for Shield and once for Heavy) because, at level 1, her mastery is only 1. She can take one instance of Improved Armor now. Then, at level 2 when her mastery increases to 2, she can take the other.  
> 
> She cannot take Improved Armor(Heavy) at level 1 and again at level 2 because this feat is limited to only 1 per armor type. 
> 
> The fighter's specialist friend cannot take this feat at all because the feat is limited to fighters only.

| **Artificer**            | You craft 1 random magic item from a category you choose. Each level up, you can craft a replacement random item, but your previous item then becomes unusable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 1   | Mage (INT)                                               |
| **Brawler**              | Your unarmed attack gains the benefits of Weapon Mastery (see below). If you are in light or no armor, this attack also gains finesse. <br><br>- You can deal the normal d2 unarmed damage with a kick, knee, elbow, etc, even if your hands are full.  <br>- If you have a hand free, your unarmed attack deals d4.  <br>- If both hands are free, you gain the benefits of two-weapon fighting.                                                                                                                | 1   | Fighter or Specialist                                    |
| **Cleave**               | When you attack with a versatile or two-handed melee weapon and you reduce your target to 0 hp, you can immediately make a second attack with the same weapon. If you are attacking with a swung weapon, the second target can be any creature within range of you. If attacking with a stabbing weapon, the second target must be on the far side of the first but your second attack gains reach.                                                                                                              | 1   | Fighter, Level 3+                                        |
| **Corporeal Magic**      | When you fail (but not critically fail) a [[Cast\|spellcasting]] roll, you can choose to add +X to the roll by taking X damage.  (This can represent blood magic, ecstatically letting the raw magic run through you unchecked, psychic strain, etc.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 1   | Spellcaster                                              |
| **Eldritch Power**       | When you cast *eldritch blast*, you can choose to either have it deal d6 damage or push the target back a step if it is Large or smaller. If the spell is exhausted, you recover it on a short rest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 1   | *eldritch blast* cantrip                                 |
| **Elemental Wild Shape** | You can adopt the form of Elementals as well as Beasts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 1   | Wild Shape, Druid 9+                                     |
| **Flurry of Blows**      | When you fight unarmed with two free hands, you deal 2d4 damage (instead of 1d4 with advantage). When you roll doubles on these damage dice, you can also impose a bane on your target.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 1   | Brawler                                                  |
| **Improved Concoctions** | Choose one talent you have. Gain +1 to checks to produce those concoctions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 3   | Specialist; Alchemy or Herbalism                         |
| **Improved Familiar**    | Your Tiny familiar can have a more robust form with hands, strong attacks, and/or minor abilities, such as a homunculus, pseudodragon, imp, quasit, or sprite.  Use the creature's stats whenever they are higher than that those normally granted to a familiar.  Roll d6s (instead of d4s) when determining its HP.  Your familiar can serve as the source of any spell (not only touch spells).                                                                                                               | 1   | Familiar, Mage 5+                                        |

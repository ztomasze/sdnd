To scribe a [[scroll]], you must:

* have this feat
* know (and have accessible) the spell you wish to scribe
* have any material component or focus required to cast the spell
* have scribing materials (see below) on hand or the ability to purchase them in your current location
* have a quiet location with a good writing surface

Determine the caster level of the scroll you are scribing. This must be <= your own level, but high enough to be able to cast the spell given its tier.  Choosing a higher caster level than the minimum to cast the spell may improve the effect of a spell that improves with the caster's mastery.

Expend (spell tier x scroll's caster level x 5 gp) to purchase the necessary scribing materials.  This includes fine parchment, paper, or papyrus; expensive inks, often infused with gem dust or relevant reagent; special quills or pens. Treat tier 0 spells as tier 1 for purposes of this gp cost. If the spell has a material component consumed by casting it, you must also pay for that.

Expend (spell tier x scroll's caster level x 1 XP) as you draw the necessary magic from your soul and infuse it into the scroll.  Treat tier 0 spells as 0 for purposes of XP cost.

Scribing one scroll takes 1 downtime day, regardless of its tier. Multiple characters cannot collaborate on a scroll.

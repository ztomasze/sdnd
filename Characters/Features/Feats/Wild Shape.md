> A [[feat]]

You can transform into an animal. 

As a minor action, make a druid spellcasting check:

- **S:** Assume the form of an animal (as limited below)
	- **CS:** The animal form gains the maximum hit points from its HD
- **F:** You fail to transform, and you cannot try again until after a short rest
	- **CF:** You cannot try again until after a long rest

When you transform:

- You gain all the physical characteristics (and corresponding game mechanics) of a typical specimen of a Small or Medium Beast that you are familiar with and that does not have more HD than your [[mastery]]. A flying creature counts as having +3 HD for this limitation.
- For the purpose of effect interactions, you are now physically a Beast. However, you are also still a Humanoid, such as for purposes of spells like Charm Person.
- You gain any special abilities or qualities of your new form, but you do not gain any of its spell-like or spellcasting abilities.
- You retain any abilities or feats tied to your mind, training, or experience, but you lose any attacks, qualities, or abilities dependent on your normal form.
- You can speak in your new form, but not in your own voice. You cannot cast spells unless you can avoid both the somatic and verbal components (for example, with [[Subtle Spellcasting]]).
- Roll the HD of the new creature type to determine your max HP while in the new form.  
	- If this rolled value is greater than your normal HP maximum, increase your current HP by the difference. 
	- If the new max is less than your normal HP maximum, your current HP does not change (even if this means your current HP is greater than your new max).
- Any gear your are wearing is absorbed into the new form and becomes non-functional until you revert to your normal form.

Your transformation ends when you sleep or if you fall unconscious.  When it does, you lose any HP you have over your normal max.

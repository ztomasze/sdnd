> A [[feat]]

You summon or bond with a Tiny animal, such as a raven, rat, cat, or frog, and imbue it with a small part of your soul. 

* The familiar has 1 HD, ([[mastery]])d4 HP, 4+(mastery) Intelligence, speaks one language of your choice, and serves you loyally. 
* Add your mastery to your familiar's AC. (Default AC: 10+mastery).
* If forced to make a save, your familiar uses your save modifiers. It gains advantage on a save if it is currently in your square. 
* Your familiar acts on your turn during combat and can interleave its actions with yours. 
* While on the same plane, you share an empathic bond. You and your familiar are aware of each other's strong emotions, physical pain, etc. 
* While your familiar is within 120' of you, you also share a telepathic bond. You can silently communicate. You can also spend a minor action while within this range to sense what your familiar does until the start of your next turn. 
* During a turn that you share your familiar's senses, your familiar can use its action to deliver a touch spell immediately after you cast it. 
* As an action, you can shunt your familiar into a safe interdimensional space or return it from that space to your hand.
* If your familiar dies, you suffer experience drain equal to its max HP. 
* You can only have one familiar at a time. You can summon or bond with a new familiar, or change the form of your current familiar, by spending 10 gp of ritual materials and 1 day of [[downtime]].

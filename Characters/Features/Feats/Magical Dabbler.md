> A [[feat]]

You can activate a [[scroll]], wand, or other magic item that requires spell knowledge even if that spell is not on your spell list or if you have no spell list at all. 

When you take this feat, choose either INT or CHA as the basis of your spellcasting rolls associated with this feat. This includes both identifying and using such magic items.

If you are not also a spellcaster, you must always roll to cast a spell from a [[scroll]] or similar item.

To craft a [[wand]], you must:

* have this feat
* know (and have accessible) the spell you wish to imbue into the wand
* have any material component or focus required to cast the spell
* have woodcarving materials (see below) on hand or the ability to purchase them in your current location

The caster level of a wand is the minimum level needed to cast the spell.

Expend (spell tier x scroll's caster level x 100 gp) to purchase the necessary wand materials.  This includes fine and exotic wood, as well as any gem dust, inset jewels, or magically resonant core materials. Treat tier 0 spells as tier 1 for purposes of this gp cost. If the spell has a material component consumed by casting it, you must also pay for that.

Expend (spell tier x scroll's caster level x 10 XP) as you draw the necessary magic from your soul and infuse it into the scroll.  Treat tier 0 spells as 0 for purposes of XP cost.

Crafting a wand takes 1 downtime day, regardless of its tier. Multiple characters cannot collaborate on a wand.

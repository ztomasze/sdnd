### domain

There are **5 knowledge domains**.  Each domain includes the ability to recognize monsters of a given type and possibly know something of their traits, powers, or weaknesses.

| Knowledge         | Topics                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Monster types                     |

### level

Character knowledge then comes in **2 levels**:

| Knowledge Level | Description of such knowledge                                                                 | DC to know Common knowledge   | DC to know Expert knowledge | DC to know Obscure knowledge |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Common**      | Known by half or more of a given wide population, such as a nation or town.                   | Normal<br><br>(+prof w/ Lore) | Very Hard                   | Impossible                   |
| **Expert**      | Typically known only by those who have studied a given field. (Always specific to do domain.) | Normal<br><br>(+prof w/ Lore) | Normal                      | Very hard                    |

In general, a GM should narrate what characters would already know or recognize based on their level of knowledge of the given topic or domain.  However, in the rare cases where the dice should decide whether they know a given fact, make an INT check using the DCs given in the table above. 

* Note that, unlike other skill proficiencies, knowledge proficiency changes the DC instead of granting you a bonus. (Exception: The Lore skill grants proficiency to any Common Knowledge roll.)
* Generally, obscure knowledge is intended to be the object of quests to find a rare authority, lost tome, or great library. However, if the GM allows a roll, then there is a chance for an expert to happen to know some obscure knowledge.

### domain

There are **5 knowledge domains**.  Each domain includes the ability to recognize monsters of a given type and possibly know something of their traits, powers, or weaknesses.

| Knowledge         | Topics                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Monster types                     |

### obscurity

The **obscurity** of a given fact or bit of information indicates how widely known it is:

| Obscurity    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                          | When rolling...                                                       | DC to know                                   |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Common**   | Widely known in a given general population, such as the locals of nation or town.                                                                                                                    | No roll required.                                                     | (Trivial)                                    |
| **Uncommon** | Known in a general population, but not by everyone. Special study is not required to encounter, know, or recognize this information. Trivia, folklore, and current rumors are good examples of this. | No expertise required to roll. Apply either Lore or domain expertise. | Easy, Normal, Hard                           |
| **Expert**   | Known only by those who have studied a given field. More than general knowledge; specific training in this domain is required.                                                                       | **Relevant domain knowledge expertise required to even roll.**        | Very Hard, Extremely Hard, Almost Impossible |
| **Obscure**  | Known by only a handful of experts. (Generally intended to be the object of quests to find a rare authority, lost tome, or great library.)                                                           | No roll.                                                              | (Impossible)                                 |

### checks

Whenever possible, the GM should simply describe or reveal relevant details immediately based on a character's knowledge level.  For example:

* If a character has the Lore skill, they probably know any Easy or Normal Uncommon knowledge. 
* If they have a specific domain knowledge, they probably know all relevant Uncommon knowledge within that domain.  In other words, after months or years of study, they automatically know what any non-expert might have chanced to pick up in passing.

The following tables summarizes this GM guidance:

| Difficulty        | Obscurity    | With no expertise | With Lore      | With domain    |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ----------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| (impossible)      | **Obscure**  | Cannot roll       | Cannot roll    | Cannot roll    |
| Nearly Impossible | **Expert**   | Cannot roll       | Cannot roll    | Roll           |
| Extremely Hard    | **Expert**   | Cannot roll       | Cannot roll    | Roll           |
| Very Hard         | **Expert**   | Cannot roll       | Cannot roll    | Roll           |
| Hard              | **Uncommon** | Roll              | Roll           | Usually known  |
| Normal            | **Uncommon** | Roll              | Usually known  | Usually known  |
| Easy              | **Uncommon** | Roll              | Usually known  | Usually known  |
| (trivial)         | **Common**   | No roll needed    | No roll needed | No roll needed |

> **Design: Requiring domain knowledge expertise to roll**  
> Expert-level rolls cannot be attempted without domain-specific expertise. This helps protect that character's investment. Without this limitation, someone with +0 INT and neither knowledge nor Lore could roll a 20 and beat an expert on a Very Hard check. Similarly, someone with only general Lore and a couple points of INT could still make an Extremely Hard check while an expert in that domain fails.

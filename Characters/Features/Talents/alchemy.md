This [[talent]] grants you the ability to prepare alchemical concoctions.

As an action, make an INT check to draw forth and use a concoction.

* S: You are able to apply the concoction, including any necessary throwing or splashing
* F: Your action is wasted and you cannot make that concoction again until you complete a long rest
 
You can instead use your action to pass a produced concoction to an adjacent ally for them to use later with their own action. Unused concoctions lose their potency at the end of the scene. 

The alchemical supplies needed to make these concoctions take up no equipment slots for you.

### Concoctions

| DC  | Concoction         | Description                                                                                                                                                                              |
| --- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 11  | **Acid**           | Make a finesse attack to splash the acid from this flask onto a adjacent target. Burns for 4 rounds, dealing 1d4 acid damage each round.                                                 |
| 12  | **Sunrod**         | Once scratched against a hard surface, this rod glows as brightly as a torch for 1 real hour, but it is heatless and cannot be extinguished.                                             |
| 13  | **Smoke bomb**     | When thrown against a hard surface, this small clay orb breaks and fills a 15' radius area with obscuring smoke (as per *obscuring mist*)                                                |
| 14  | **Tanglefoot bag** | When thrown up to 30' at a creature as an attack, this soft sack breaks open, covering the target in a sticky hardening goo, equivalent to the Web spell for that one target (no focus). |
| 15  | **Thunderstone**   | When this fist-sized grey stone hits a hard surface, it explodes, causing all creatures within a 15' radius to take 1d6 damage and be deafened for the rest of the scene.                |

This [[talent]] grants you the ability to hit foes where it really hurts.

If you hit a creature who is unaware of your attack with a light weapon or ranged weapon, add (mastery)d6 to the damage.  You can also sneak attack a creature who is aware of you if you sacrifice either a boon or a bane that would have applied to the attack roll before rolling.

Making a sneak attack relies on you being able to apply your knowledge of anatomy and weak spots. Therefore, you can generally only sneak attack humanoids, beasts, and other creatures with similar anatomy that is susceptible to such attacks. 

Additionally, you must be able to reach those spots.  You cannot sneak attack a giant if you can't reach higher than his knee.

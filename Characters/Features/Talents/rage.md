This [[talent]] lets you enter a wild and reckless battle frenzy. For a single combat, this makes you a powerhouse of slaughter, but your abandon exposes you to greater physical danger.

*([[fighter]] only)*

On your turn, you can start to rage as a free action. While raging, you:

* gain (mastery)d4+4 temporary hit points
* gain the Weapon Mastery [[feats|feat]] with any STR-based weapons
* gain advantage on any STR-based [[check|checks]] (including attacks)
* gain advantage on Will saves

However, due to your reckless, you:

* gain a -4 AC penalty
* lose any benefits from the Improved Armor [[feats|feat]]
* gain disadvantage on Reflex saves
* cannot make spellcasting checks or perform other tasks that require close or careful attention.

Your rage lasts until the end of the scene. It ends early if you fall unconscious.

When your rage ends, you lose any temporary hit points. You canâ€™t rage again until you [[resting|short rest]].

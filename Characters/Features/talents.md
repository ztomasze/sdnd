Each **talent** grants you an additional capability or bonus. 

Characters gain talents through [[level advancement]] and from some [[ancestry|ancestries]] and [[class|classes]].  Every character starts with at least one talent.

There are some limitations on the talents you can take:

* Some talents are limited to only certain classes or require certain prerequisites.
* You cannot take the same talent more times than your current [[mastery]].
* You cannot take the same talent more than the **Max** listed in the table below. 

> **Example**  
> A level 1 human fighter gets to choose 1 talent for being human and one being a level 1 character. However, that fighter cannot take Improved Armor twice (once for Shield and once for Heavy) because, at level 1, her mastery is only 1. She can take one instance of Improved Armor now. Then, at level 2 when her mastery increases to 2, she can take the other.  
> 
> She cannot take Improved Armor(Heavy) at level 1 and again at level 2 because this talent is limited to only 1 per type. 
> 
> The fighter's specialist friend cannot take this talent at all because the talent is limited to fighters only.

| **Brawler**               | Your unarmed attack gains the benefits of Weapon Mastery (see below). If you are in light or no armor, this attack also gains finesse. <br><br>- You can deal the normal d2 unarmed damage with a kick, knee, elbow, etc, even if your hands are full.  <br>- If you have a hand free, your unarmed attack deals d4.  <br>- If both hands are free, you gain the benefits of two-weapon fighting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 1          | Fighter or Specialist                                    |
| **Cleave**                | When you attack with a versatile or two-handed melee weapon and you reduce your target to 0 hp, you can apply any remaining damage to a second target in range. Your initial attack roll must be good enough to also hit the second target. If you are attacking with a swung weapon, the second target can be any creature within range of you. If attacking with a stabbing weapon, the second target must be on the far side of the first but your second attack gains reach.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 1          | Fighter, Level 2+                                        |
| **Corporeal Magic**       | When you fail a [[Cast\|spellcasting]] roll, you can choose to add +X to the roll by taking X damage.

| **Familiar**              | You summon or bond with a small animal, such as a raven, rat, cat, or frog. This familiar speaks Common and serves you loyally. While it is within 120' of you, you share a telepathic bond, you know what it is sensing, and it can be the source of spells you cast: Treat it as though it were you for determining spell ranges. *Once per day, you can make a spellcasting check to swap places with your familiar within far range as a move*. If your familiar dies, you can restore it to life by reducing your max HP by 1d4 (to a min of 1).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 1          | Mage                                                     |
| **Flurry of Blows**       | When you fight unarmed with two free hands, you deal 2d4 damage (instead of 1d4 with advantage). When you roll doubles on these damage dice, you can also impose a bane on your target.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 1          | Brawler                                                  |

| **Rage**                  | On your turn, you can enter a reckless battle rage as a free action. While raging, you gain advantage on STR-based attacks and checks and +1d4 to damage on STR-based attacks, but you cannot make spellcasting checks or perform other tasks that require close or careful attention.  <br>  <br>Due to your recklessness, any attacks made against you while raging have advantage and you lose any benefits from the Improved Armor talent.  <br>  <br>Your rage ends if you fall unconscious, if you choose to end it at the start of your turn, or at the end of the scene.

| **Wild Shape**            | As a minor action, make a druid spellcasting check:<br>- **S:** Assume the form of an animal<br>- **CS:** Gain the max HP of that animal<br>- **F:** You cannot try again until after a short rest<br>- **CF:** You cannot try again until after a long rest<br><br>When you transform:<br><br>- You gain all the physical characteristics (and corresponding game mechanics) of a typical specimen of a Small or Medium beast you are familiar with and that does not have more HD than your mastery. A flying creature counts as having +3 HD for this limitation.<br>- You are physically a Beast, but you are also still a Humanoid (such as for purposes of spells like Charm Person).<br>- Any gear your are wearing is absorbed into the new form and becomes non-functional until you revert to your normal form. <br>- Roll the HD of the new creature type and gain that many temporary HP. You revert to your normal form if you lose consciousness or all of your temporary HP. You may spend a minor action to purge all of your temporary hit points and thus revert to your normal form.<br>- You can speak in your new form, but not in your own voice. You cannot cast spells unless you can avoid both the somatic and verbal components (for example, with Subtle Spell) | 1          | Druid, Level 4+                                          |

Each **feat** grants you an additional capability or bonus. 

Characters gain feats through [[level advancement]] and from some [[ancestry|ancestries]] and [[class|classes]].  Every character starts with at least one feat.

There are some limitations on the feats you can take:

* Some feats are limited to only certain classes or require certain prerequisites.
* You cannot take the same feat more times than your current [[mastery]].
* You cannot take the same feat more than the **Max** listed in the table below. 

> **Example**  
> A level 1 human fighter gets to choose 1 feat for being human and one being a level 1 character. However, that fighter cannot take Improved Armor twice (once for Shield and once for Heavy) because, at level 1, her mastery is only 1. She can take one instance of Improved Armor now. Then, at level 2 when her mastery increases to 2, she can take the other.  
> 
> She cannot take Improved Armor(Heavy) at level 1 and again at level 2 because this feat is limited to only 1 per armor type. 
> 
> The fighter's specialist friend cannot take this feat at all because the feat is limited to fighters only.

If attacking with a stabbing weapon, the second target must be on the far side of the first but your second attack gains reach.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 1          | Fighter, Level 3+                                        |
| **Corporeal Magic**       | When you fail a [[Cast\|spellcasting]] roll, you can choose to add +X to the roll by taking X damage.  (This can represent blood magic, ecstatically letting the raw magic run through you unchecked, psychic strain, etc.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 1          | Spellcaster                                              |
| **Eldritch Power**        | When you cast Eldritch Blast, you can choose to either have it deal d6 damage or push the target back a step if it is Large or smaller.

| **Familiar**              | You summon or bond with a Tiny animal, such as a raven, rat, cat, or frog. This familiar has 1 HD, (mastery)d4 HP, 4+(mastery) Intelligence, speaks one language of your choice, and serves you loyally. Add your mastery to your familiar's AC (default 10+). Your familiar acts on your turn during combat and can interleave its actions with yours. While on the same plane, you share an empathic bond. While your familiar is within 120' of you, you share a telepathic bond and you can spend a minor action to sense what it does until the start of your next turn. During a turn that you share your familiar's senses, your familiar can use its action to deliver a touch spell immediately after you cast it. As an action, you can shunt your familiar into an interdimensional space or return it from that space to your hand. If forced to make a save, the familiar uses your save modifiers, gaining advantage if it is currently in your square. If your familiar dies, you suffer experience drain equal to its max HP. You can summon or bond with a new familiar, or change the form of your current familiar, by spending 10gp of ritual materials and 1 day of downtime.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 1          | Mage, Level 3+                                           |
| **Flurry of Blows**       | When you fight unarmed with two free hands, you deal 2d4 damage (instead of 1d4 with advantage). When you roll doubles on these damage dice, you can also impose a bane on your target.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 1          | Brawler                                                  |

| **Improved Familiar**     | Your Tiny familiar can have a more robust form with hands, strong attacks, and/or minor abilities, such as a homunculus, pseudodragon, imp, quasit, or sprite.  Use the creature's stats whenever they are higher than that those normally granted to a familiar.  Roll d6s (instead of d4s) when determining its HP.

| **Wild Shape**            | As a minor action, make a druid spellcasting check:<br>- **S:** Assume the form of an animal<br>- **CS:** Gain the max HP of that animal<br>- **F:** You cannot try again until after a short rest<br>- **CF:** You cannot try again until after a long rest<br><br>When you transform:<br><br>- You gain all the physical characteristics (and corresponding game mechanics) of a typical specimen of a Small or Medium beast that you are familiar with and that does not have more HD than your mastery. A flying creature counts as having +3 HD for this limitation.<br>- You are physically a Beast, but you are also still a Humanoid (such as for purposes of spells like Charm Person).<br>- You gain any special abilities or qualities of the new form, but you do not gain any spell-like or spellcasting abilities.<br>- You retain any abilities or feats tied to your mind, training, or experience, but you lose any attacks, qualities, or abilities dependent on your normal form.<br>- You can speak in your new form, but not in your own voice. You cannot cast spells unless you can avoid both the somatic and verbal components (for example, with Subtle Spell)<br>- Roll the HD of the new creature type to determine your max HD while in the new form.  If this rolled value is greater than your normal max HP, increase your current HP by the difference. If the new max is less, your current HP does not change (even if this means your current HP is greater than your new max).<br>- Any gear your are wearing is absorbed into the new form and becomes non-functional until you revert to your normal form.<br><br>Your transformation ends if you fall unconscious.  When it does, you lose any HP you have over your normal max. | 1          | Druid, Level 3+                                          |

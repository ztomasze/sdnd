### notes

##### quiver
A quiver holds enough for 20 shots. You can draw from a quiver as a free action. You can only carry one quiver of arrows or bolts or two quivers for stones or bullets. If you need more ammo, perhaps you can have a non-shooting friend carry an extra one for you and swap them when yours gets empty.

You are assumed to be recovering what ammo you can after each combat, but that ammo may take a little cleanup or minor repair before they are ready to be fired again.  If you have the fletchery [[intelligence#craft|craft]] or *mending* cantrip, you can refill your quiver over a long rest.  (Firearms would require a shell-reloading craft.)

> **Option: Ammo die**  
> If you are using a Loading(1) weapon and don't want to track every shot that you fire, you can use this variant instead: Roll an ammo die along with each shot you make. This starts as a d12: Your quiver is nearly full.  On a 1, your quiver is now half full: Drop your ammo die to a d6.  On a 1, your quiver is a quarter full: Drop to a d4.  On a 1: You are down to one last shot.  Better make it count!
> 
> This variant is expected to a little more than 20 shots on average, which compensates for the fact that sometimes you'll get fewer than that. There is a 1-in-288 chance that an ammo-die quiver only holds 4 shots.

### gear notes

##### quiver
You can only carry one quiver. If you need more ammo, perhaps you can have a non-shooting friend carry an extra one for you and swap out when yours gets empty.

You are assumed to be recovering what ammo you can after each combat, but they may take a little cleanup or minor repair before they are ready to be fired again.  If you have the fletchery [[intelligence#craft|craft]] or *mending* cantrip, you can refill your quiver over a long rest.

If you don't want to track every shot that you fire, you can use this variant instead: Roll an ammo die along with each shot you make. This starts as a d12: Your quiver is nearly full.  On a 1, your quiver is half full: Drop your ammo die to a d6.  On a 1, your quiver is now a quarter full: Drop to a d4.  On a 1: You are down to one last shot.  Better make it count!

> **Design: Ammo die**  
> This variant is expected to give you an average of 23 shots. This slight boost over 20 compensates for the fact that sometimes you'll get fewer than that. There is a 1-in-288 chance than an ammo-die quiver only holds 4 shots.

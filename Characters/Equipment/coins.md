1 gold piece (gp) = 10 silver pieces (sp) = 100 copper pieces (cp). 

- Your coin purse (containing the first 100 coins you carry) takes up no [[equipment slots]].   
- Once that is full, every 100 coins (or part thereof) take up a slot

Some settings may include coins of additional metals, such as platinum (1 pp = 10 gp) or electrum (1 ep = 5 sp).

### color of your purse

This option allows you to skip tracking minor expenses as your wealth level increases.  Imagine opening your coin purse and noting the dominant color of the coins in there. If any single coin there could pay for more than this expense, you can ignore that cost.

You start with a "copper" purse.  You must pay 100 x a coin of the next color to increase one level. However, if the GM feels you are abusing this by ignoring a great many expenses in a short period (typically 10x the current level in a day) your purse will downgrade a level.

| Color    | Cost up upgrade to this level | Ignore costs that are… | Downgrade if you ignore more than … per day |

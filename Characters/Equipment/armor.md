Your [[class]] and [[talents]] determine the types of armor you can use.
### type

You need to be proficient with an armor's type to wear it without penalty.  Your armor type proficiency also determines which shields you can use effectively, as noted in the table below.Â 

If you don armor or a shield you are not [[proficiency|proficient]] with, you are -4 on any STR or DEX roll that the armor might hamper (including attacks), and you cannot cast spells.

Heavier armors impose some penalties even when you are proficient:

* **In metal armor that takes 2 or more slots:** You are at disadvantage on stealth checks and can't swim.

The GM may impose other similar penalties, such as disadvantage on swim checks in padded armor or while carrying a metal shield.

### armor class (AC)

If you wear no armor, your AC is 10 + DEX.

When you wear armor, you gain the armor's AC + DEX.  Shields add to this AC. 

### max DEX

When you add your DEX to your AC, you can't add or subtract more than this value, which is provided in the armor table below.  

> **Example**  
> You are playing a theurge with light armor proficiency and -2 DEX.  Unarmored, you have AC 8.  Your light armor options are leather AC 9, studded AC 10, or padded AC 13.
> 
> Your friend is playing a specialist with light armor proficiency and +3 DEX. Her options are unarmored AC 13, leather AC 14, studded AC 14, or padded AC 13.

### slots

Some armor requires more [[equipment slots]] to wear or carry.

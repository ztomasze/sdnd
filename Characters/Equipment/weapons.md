Your [[ancestry]], [[class]], and [[feat|feats]] determine the weapons you can use. 

* Weapons are necessary to make an [[attack]].
* If you use a weapon you are not [[proficiency|proficient]] with, your attacks with it are made at -4.

### type

- **Melee:** Use this weapon to attack an adjacent target using STR
- **Ranged:** Attack a target up to the given [[distance|range]] using DEX. 
	-  You can attack up to twice a ranged weapon’s range at disadvantage.
	- If you make a ranged attack while [[threatened]], you are at disadvantage. (You can typically step back as a [[Move]] to negate this.)

### properties
  
- **Finesse:** You can attack with this weapon using either STR or DEX
- **Loading:** You must spend an action to load this weapon before you can use it.  In the case of Loading(#), you load # shots each time you load it.
- **Reach:** You can attack a target that is either 5' or 10' away.    
- **Thrown:** You can hurl this weapon to make a ranged attack (see above) using either STR or DEX. 
- **Two-handed: (2H):** You must use two hands to wield this weapon.
- **Versatile (V):** Deal the first damage value listed when wielding this weapon in one hand or the second damage value listed if wielding it in two hands. [[ancestry#size|Small]] characters are limited in their use of larger versatile weapons.

### proficiency by class

Abbreviations used are: Cleric (C), Druid (D), Specialist (Sp), Fighter (F), Mage (M, or subclasses S, Ta, Te, W).

**Special notes:**

- **Garrote:** You can initiate a [[Grapple]] using DEX. When you grapple a target with a garrote, they cannot speak or breathe and they take 1d4 damage at the end of each of their turns if they remain grappled.
- **Shotgun:** You can fire both shots at once to gain advantage on the attack.

**Firearm ammo.** When using firearms, you still need a "quiver" to carry your ammo.  This takes the form of "a horn of powder and a bag of shot" for flintlock weapons and "a gun belt" with bullets in leather loops for more modern firearms.

> **Design: Firearms**  
> The details here will depend on the campaign setting. They are currently weighted as only slight improvements to bows and crossbows to avoid unbalancing the game in campaign settings where they are largely the norm for ranged weapons, such as in a Musketeers or western setting.  On the other hand, in a renaissance setting where new flintlock firearms should clearly outshine the existing medieval technology, the die-size of flintlocks could be increased one step (or even two?) and an correspondingly high price tag placed on them, such as 250 or 500 gp. Their "quivers" might also be more expensive.

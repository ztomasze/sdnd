Your [[ancestry]], [[class]], and [[talents]] determine the weapons you can use. 

* Weapons are necessary to make an [[attack]].
* If you use a weapon you are not [[proficiency|proficient]] with, your attacks with it are made at -4.

### type

- **Melee:** Use this weapon to attack an adjacent target using STR
- **Ranged:** Attack a target up to the given [[distance|range]] using DEX. 
	-  You can attack up to twice a ranged weapon’s range at disadvantage.
	- If you make a ranged attack while [[threatened]], you are at disadvantage. (You can typically step back as a [[Move]] to negate this.)

### properties
  
- **Finesse:** You can attack with this weapon using either STR or DEX
- **Loading:** You must spend an action to load this weapon before you can use it.  In the case of Loading(#), you load # shots each time you load it.
- **Reach:** You can attack a target that is either 5' (adjacent) or 10' (close) away.    
- **Thrown:** You can hurl this weapon to make a ranged attack (see above) using either STR or DEX. 
- **Two-handed: (2H):** You must use two hands to wield this weapon.
- **Versatile (V):** Deal the first damage value listed when wielding this weapon in one hand or the second damage value listed if wielding it in two hands. [[ancestry#size|Small]] characters are limited in their use of larger versatile weapons.

**Special notes:**

- **Garrote:** You can initiate a grapple using DEX. When you grapple a target with a garrote, they cannot speak or breathe and they take 1d4 damage at the end of each of their turns if they remain grappled.
- **Shotgun:** You can fire both shots at once to gain advantage on the attack.

**Firearm ammo.** When using firearms, you still need a "quiver" to carry your ammo.  This takes the form of "a horn of powder and a bag of shot" for flintlock weapons and "a gun belt" with bullets in leather loops for more modern firearms.

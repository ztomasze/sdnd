You have a number of equipment slots equal to your Strength, minimum 10.Â  

Unless otherwise noted, each item you wear or carry takes up one equipment slot.

### special gear

Your [[class]] or certain [[skills]] may give you items that take up no slots for you.  They would take up a slot if you gave them to someone else.

Certain items, such as the first backpack you carry, also take up no slots.  Other large or bulky items (like long weapons or heavy armor) take up more than one slot.

### tiny items

Any item that is finger-sized or smaller generally counts as a tiny item.  You can carry 5 tiny items per slot.  [[coins|Coins]] are an exception to this.

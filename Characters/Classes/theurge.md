A theurge pursues magic as a mystical, personal, or transcendent endeavor. Theurges eschew the workings and trappings of the three common magical traditions. Instead, they either forge their own intuitive paths, or they follow lesser known traditions such as the magic of song, creation, or faerie.

**Spellcasting:** You can learn spells from any spell list (Arcane, Divine, or Primal).  Choose INT, WIS, or CHA as your spellcasting ability. You suffer no mishaps for critically failing a spellcasting roll.  See [[magic]] or more. 

**Unique Tradition:** You are treated as having no spell list for the purposes of using magic items like scrolls and wands (even regarding spells you know), unless done through the use of other features such as [[Magical Dabbler]].  You cannot create magic items.

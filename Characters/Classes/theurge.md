A theurge pursues magic as a mystical, personal, or transcendent endeavor. Theurges eschew the workings and trappings of the three common magical traditions. Instead, they either forge their own intuitive paths, or they follow lesser known traditions such as the magic of song, creation, or faerie.

**Weapons:** Some. See the [[weapons]] table

**Skill:** Gain Languages, Lore, OR Medicine.

**Spellcasting:** You can learn spells from any spell list (Arcane, Divine, or Primal). However, you have no class spell list, so you cannot use spell-based magic items like scrolls and wands, even of spells you know, unless done through the use of other features.  Choose INT, WIS, or CHA as your spellcasting ability. You suffer no mishaps for critically failing a spellcasting roll. See [[magic]] or more.

**Special: Deity.** Choose an appropriate deity from your campaign setting to serve.  You gain a related holy symbol, which takes up no slots for you.

**Languages:** Gain one additional language appropriate to your deity, such as Celestial, Infernal, Primordial, etc.

**Skill:** Gain Languages, Lore, OR Medicine

**Spellcasting:** You cast Divine spells using WIS or CHA. See [[spellcasting]] for more.

**Turn Undead:** As an action, you must present your holy symbol and speak clearly. Roll 2d6 to determine the total HD of undead to be affected.  Undead with HD greater than your level are unaffected.  If your level is at least twice the undead creature's HD, it is destroyed instead of turned.  A minimum of one affectable undead creature is turned or destroyed with each turning attempt. Only undead within a near distance are affected, first by fewer HD and then by closeness.  Turned undead are [[terrified]].

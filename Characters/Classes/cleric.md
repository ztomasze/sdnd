**HD:** d6  

**Armor:** All  

**Weapons:** Some. See the [[weapons]] table

---

**Special: Deity.** Choose an appropriate deity from your campaign setting to serve.  You gain a related holy symbol, which takes up no slots for you.

**Languages:** Gain one additional language appropriate to your deity, such as Celestial, Infernal, Primordial, etc.

**Skill:** Gain Languages, Lore, OR Medicine

**Spellcasting:** You cast Divine spells using WIS or CHA. See [[magic]] for more.

**Turn Undead:** As an action, present your holy symbol and speak clearly. Roll 2d6 to determine the total HD of undead to be affected. Undead with HD greater than your level are unaffected. If your level is at least twice the undead creature's HD, it is destroyed instead of turned. Only undead within 30' are affected, first by fewer HD and then by closeness. Turned undead are [[terrified]] of you for the remainder of the scene. If you fail to turn at least one undead, you cannot turn again this scene. (Before rolling, you can choose to roll only 1d6 in order to treat your level as one higher.)

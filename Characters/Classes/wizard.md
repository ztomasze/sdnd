A wizard is the classic arcane spellcaster who spends their time pouring over ancient tomes and conducting magical experiments in secretive colleges or distant towers. Some of these scholars will venture from the safety of their studies into dungeons or ruins in search of lost lore.

**Skill:** Gain Languages OR Lore.

**Spellcasting:** You cast prepared Arcane spells using INT. See [[magic]] for more.

**Spellbook.** You prepare spells from those in your spellbook, which does not take up an equipment slot for you. You start with 6 spells of tier 1 in your spellbook. Each time you gain a level, you can add two more spells of a tier you can cast. 

You can cast any [[ritual]] spell from your spellbook as a ritual even if you do not currently have the spell prepared.

You can add Arcane spells that you find to your spellbook. You can attempt to scribe one spell from a scroll per long rest. First, you must identify the [[scroll]]. The scroll's spell must be on you class list and of a tier that you can cast. If so, make a spellcasting check DC 10 + spell tier. On a success, you scribe the spell into your spellbook.  On either a success or failure, the scroll is consumed.

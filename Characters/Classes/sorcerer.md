**HD:** d6

**Armor:** None  

**Weapons:** Few. See the [[weapons]] table

---

**Spellcasting:** You cast learned Arcane spells using CHA. See [[magic]] for more.

**Special: Magical Wellspring.** You have a number of d6 wellspring dice equal to your mastery.

- When you fail (but not critically fail) a spellcasting roll, you may expend one wellspring die to add it to your roll, potentially converting the failure to a success.
- When you successfully cast an instant spell that deals damage, you may expend one wellspring die to add it to the spell’s damage roll.  

Regain one expended wellspring die on a short rest and all on a long rest.

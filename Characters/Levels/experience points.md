The GM awards players **experience points (XP)** based on good roleplaying and in-game accomplishments. 

XP is the "score" for your play, but the GM determines the nature of the game, so talk to them about their intention here. Depending on the game, simply killing monsters and collecting loot doesn't automatically earn you XP, but it might. Solving problems, completing quests, and exploring the world can also earn you XP.Â  Taking risks, upholding your character's bonds, oaths, and ideals, or embracing genre tropes may also earn XP.

The primary value of XP is to buy [[level advancement|character levels]], but XP can also be spent on [[luck]] and certain crafting and downtime activities.

You start the game with 1 XP.


> **GM Tip: XP per session**   
> From [[level advancement]], you can see that it takes 450 XP for a character to reach level 10. While characters can convert gold to additional XP through carousing, they should also be spending XP on luck and downtime activities.  Therefore, 450 to 500 XP is a good starting estimate for a full character progression. If you play weekly (with a few holiday or rescheduling breaks), this works out to an average of 10 XP per session to reach level 10 by the end of a year.  
> 
> Based on this estimate, you can bump this value up or down to a progression rate that works for you.  You don't have to award this amount every session.  You might award more for sessions that conclude an adventure or story arc and less that for those that are spent on shopping and downtime.  Or you might award less XP for mooks but lots for the boss at the end of the dungeon.
> 
> Once you know what your average goal value is, you can decide which activities you want players or characters to accomplish in order to earn that XP.

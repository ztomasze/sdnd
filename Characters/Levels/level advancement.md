To purchase the next **level** in your class, you must spend 10 XP x your current level.  

>**Example**
>You are level 1.  You must spend 10 XP to reach level 2.  You must then spend 20 XP to reach level 3.

You can typically only do this as part of a downtime event.

Each time you level up:  

- **HP:** Your hp will increase (min: 1), as described above under [[hit points]].
- **Benefit:** You gain the benefit listed below for your new level.Â  This is either a talent of your choice, or two points that you can use to increase your ability scores (either +2 to one score or +1 to two different scores). 
- **Mastery:** As described previously, your [[mastery]] improves with each even level.

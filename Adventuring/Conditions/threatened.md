> A [[condition]]

An enemy is close enough to make a melee attack on you and is currently capable of doing so.

This imposes disadvantage on certain actions as you need to look to your defense. For example:
 
 * You are at disadvantage if you [[Attack]] with a [[weapons#type|ranged weapon]].
 * You cannot perform an [[Attack#coup de grace]]
 * You might be at disadvantage while performing a skill that requires close attention, like picking a lock or disarming a trap

A **condition** is basically a tag that is applied to a creature, or sometimes to a location or scene.  For example, *blind*, *dazzled*, *invisible*, and *darkness* are all tags related to vision. The first three apply to a character; the last (*darkness*) would apply to a location and thus affect all characters in it.

### adjudicating effects

The effects of a given condition are adjudicated by the GM in terms of common sense and the specific narrative context. The following is a framework to help the GM determine how the presence of one or more conditions changes the normal rules of the game.

A condition potentially imposes an effect whenever a creature is trying to perform a specific action. 

First, a condition might impact **the creature performing the action** in these ways:

- **Can't.** That action is no longer possible. For example, an *immobile* creature can't move or take any action that requires physical movement.  They could still focus on a spell or hold a telepathic conversation, though. If you are *charmed* by the handsome fey prince, you are no longer willing to attack him.
- **Harder.** Either:
	- An action that normally requires a roll is now made at disadvantage. For example, a fighter *tangled* in a web might now swing their weapon at disadvantage. 
	- An action that previously didn't require a roll or even an action might now require one.  After getting roaringly *drunk*, it now takes a DEX check to cross the gangplank to the ship when this is normally automatic.
- **Can.** The condition may not affect the action from how it is normally performed.  Or a condition like *flying* might make a new mode of movement available.
- **Easier.** The action can now be performed with advantage.

Second, a condition on **the target of the action** might affect the action in the same ways:

- **Can't**. If you have no idea where the *invisible* imp is right now, you can't line up a bow shot on it.
- **Harder.** If the target is *obscured* by fog, you are now at disadvantage to shoot it.
- **Can.** The target's condition doesn't really change your action. While the goblin is *dazed* and unable to take actions himself, he is still aware of you and so is as ready to dodge your blow as normal.
- **Easier.** Now that the orc is sprawled *prone* at your feet, you can swing your greatsword down on him with advantage.

 A condition of **the location or scene** might also come into play in similar ways.

### effects are contextual

The same condition tag might also apply slightly differently in different specific contexts. 

For example, a wizard might be inhibited to a different degree when a kobold had *grabbed* him by the robes verses when an orc has *grabbed* him around the throat. 

Similarly, if you are magically *held*, you probably can't move at all. On the other hand, if you are *held* by a giant rubbery tentacle wrapped around you from head to foot, you might still be able to make a STR or DEX check to wiggle your hand down to the ring in your belt pouch or to try to wriggle free altogether.  If you are *held* by an animated vine wrapped around your lower leg, you can't move from where you are, but you can probably make unimpeded bow shots at the closing velociraptors. 

A *burning* character might be at disadvantage when making an attack, but a *burning* zombie would likely carry on uncaringly.

As a longer example, your characters is crawling through a tunnel on hands and knees. You just got to a short section where you have to drop onto your belly and pull yourself through on your elbows. A kobold suddenly darts into the tunnel ahead of you and threatens you with a sharp stick.  The fact that you are *squeezing* through this tunnel need not be as simple as “you have disadvantage on all attacks”.

* A shortsword or spear would likely still be usable in this tunnel. While the GM might still impose disadvantage on them, it also seems that there is some counterbalancing advantage over the kobold since it also can’t dodge aside as easily in the narrow confines.
* A longsword could be used to stab if it is already in hand, but is heavier and more unwieldy than a shortsowrd. A hatchet could still be swung in a short arc. Both weapons are probably at disadvantage.
* A maul, greataxe, or longbow can’t be used at all in such tight confines. But if you were pushing the maul ahead of you, you might be able to use the large stone head for half cover in the narrow tunnel. 

As GM, you don’t have to determine such ramifications for all weapons ahead of time, but only in the moment for the single weapon in question. Such a ruling should generally not surprise the players. You don't have to explicitly warn them about the limitations of their weapons; that should be a logical conclusion from the context. But you do need to adequately describe that context. If you only say, "You enter a narrower tunnel," the extent of the danger is easy to miss. Describing that they are now crawling on their hands and knees, or even on their belly, means all kinds of new dangers and limitations are now possible.

### ending a condition

Most conditions have a logical conclusion. You are no longer *prone* once you stand up, and there is no more *darkness* once you can light a fresh torch. However, others, like being *dazed* or *poisoned* or *burning*, might have a time limit (such end of next turn or round or day) or an action required to end them.

### specific conditions

While the possible range of conditions is endless by the rules above, the following conditions are used widely enough elsewhere in these rules to warrant a little further detail regarding their intended ramifications. 

Like any condition, the GM may expand or tailor the details or effects of these conditions based on the specific context.

* [[dying]]*
* [[dying|stable]]*
* [[threatened]]
* [[unaware]]
* [[unconscious]]

##### Fear

Scared (shaken)
Frightened
Terrified (panicked)
##### Diseased

For a default "filth fever" kind of disease:

At the end of each long rest, make a hard CON save

- F: Take 1d4 CON damage
	- CF: Take 4 CON damage
- If tended by someone skilled in Medicine over the rest, gain advantage. 
    

##### Poisoned

Typically at disadvantage on most rolls.

At the end of each round, make a hard CON save
- S: No damage this round
	- CS: End the poison

You might be asleep, knocked out, or comatose. 

* You are totally out of it - immobile, prone, blind, [[unaware]] of everything.
* You can't take any actions.
- An adjacent enemy with a deadly weapon who is not themselves currently [[threatened]] can spend their action to kill you with an [[Attack#coup de grace]].

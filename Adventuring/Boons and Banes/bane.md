A **bane** is a temporary distraction to a creature in combat. It represents that creature being momentarily on the back foot, off-balance, flustered, reeling, unguarded, etc. When you give a bane to a target, you should describe what you're doing to the creature to produce it. 

When a creature has a bane: 

- the next attack made that targets that creature gains +d6 to the roll
- the next [[Attack]] or [[Wrestle]] roll made by that creature suffers -d6

> Part of [[boons and banes]]

A [[boon]] represents a creature having a momentary reprieve or opportunity in combat to look around, seize an opening, reposition a shield, get better footing, etc.

When a creature has a boon:

- the next attack that targets the creature suffers -d6 if the creature with the boon can see the incoming attack
- the next [[Attack]] or [[Grapple]] roll made by that creature gains +d6

> Part of [[boons and banes]]

[[bane|Banes]] and [[boon|boons]] are like very short-lived [[condition|conditions]]. However, rather than being a flavorful tag that the GM applies mechanics to, boons and banes are more like a mechanic that the GM and players provide flavor to.Â 

Because they produce a d6-based bonus or penalty, boons and banes can easily be represented by handing out d6 dice of two different colors.

### cancel each other

If you gain a boon while you have bane (or a bane while you have boon), the two cancel each other out.

### applied automatically

A boon or bane's effect is applied at the first opportunity (as defined for [[boon]] or [[bane]]), and then it is then removed. 

If you have more than one boon or bane, only one is applied per triggering event.

### short-lived

At the end of a creature's turn, if that creature still has any boons or banes that it did not gain during that turn, they are removed.

As with [[disease]], a creature can be exposed to a poison through contact, injury, inhalation, or consumption.

* When initially exposed, make a (hidden) Fortitude [[save]] or suffer the initial effect.
* Then, regardless of the outcome of the first save, make a second save about a minute later (at the end of the current [[scene]]) or suffer the secondary effect.

The default poison deals 1d6 life drain, 1d6 life drain. (This is equivalent to black adder venom.)  With a bad exposure, this is deadly enough to kill an average victim, unless quick counter measures are taken during the first minute. Even then, the victim will have difficulty do anything effectively until after a few days of recovery.

A creature can be exposed to a disease through a contaminated attack, touching a dirty item, breathing foul air, or consuming tainted food or drink. 

When initially exposed, make a (hidden) Fortitude [[save]].
* **S:** You have avoided infection; not further rolls are needed for this exposure.
* **F:** You are now infected with the disease.  
 
Once infected, you take the disease's drain at the end of the incubation period.  This is generally at the end of the next night's [[resting|rest]] for a 1-day incubation, the end of the second night's rest for a 2-day incubation, and so on.

Once drained in this way, make a Fort save at the end of each subsequent next night's rest to avoid taking the disease's damage again.

* If another character tends to for the preceding day and night, they can make a Medicine roll, which you can use in place of your Fort save.
* You still heal from [[drain]] normally while diseased. (This means most diseases are not fat)
* Once a disease has debilitated you either physically or mentally, any remaining drain is life drain.

If you succeed your save twice in a row, you recover from the disease.

**Filth fever** is the default disease.

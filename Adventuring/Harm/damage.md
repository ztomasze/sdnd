**Damage** you take reduces your current [[hit points]] by that amount.Â 

### type

Damage can have a type.  This is an open set of types that includes:

* **bludgeoning**, **slashing**, or **piercing** depending on the nature of the weapon
* **acid,** **cold**, **fire**, and **lightning** as elemental damage
* **magic** damage from non-elemental damaging spells or enchanted weapons
* **radiant** damage channelled from the righteous powers of heaven
* **necrotic** damage channelled from the dark forces of death and hell
* **thunder** damage from thunderous effects or explosions
* **silver**, **adamantine**, or other exotic materials based on the weapon used

### type effects

Some damage types might always have an given quality or side effect.  Examples:

* **Fire** damage always ignites very flammable materials, such as oil or tinder.  (Igniting combustible materials like paper or clothing might take more than an [[instant|instantaneous]] fire damage effect.)
* **Necrotic** damage does not harm non-living creatures (undead and constructs)
* **Thunder** damage is negated in an area of magical silence.

### resistance, immunity, and vulnerability

Depending on the damage type and the qualities of the target of that damage, the damage amount might change before it is deducted from the target's hit point.

- **Resistant:** You take half damage, round down, minimum 1.
- **Immune:** You take no damage.
* **Vulnerable:** You take double damage.

For example, skeletons might be vulnerable to bludgeoning damage and a werewolf might be immune to weapon damage unless it is silver damage.

Immunity might narratively mean the creature is impervious or they may heal such damage nearly instantly.

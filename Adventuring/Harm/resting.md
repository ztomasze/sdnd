A **rest** lets you recover some of your character's resources.

A rest can be defined either by its **duration** (*hour* or *night*) or by its **effect** (*brief*, *short*, or *long*).  Most of the time, an hour's rest provides a short rest and a night's rest provides a long rest, but **excursions** can change that.

### duration

##### hour's rest

To take a hour's rest, you need to find a safe and comfortable place with light in order to drop your pack, loosen armor, stretch sore muscles, sit down, tend wounds, and have a drink and a bite to eat. This generally takes an hour. You might be ambushed, and GM may decree that the place is comfortable enough to gain the benefits of one rest but not more.

This normally grants you the benefits of a short rest.

##### night's rest

To complete a night's rest, you need to meet all the conditions for a short rest, plus the ability to stretch out and sleep. You must consume 1 ration.  A long rest generally takes 8 hours. You can take a break for light tasks like taking a turn on watch.  If you face a significant interruption, make a CON check to still gain the benefits of the rest.

This normally grants you the benefits of a long rest.

### effect
##### brief rest

If you complete the brief rest without interruption: 

* Recover 1 HP

##### short rest

If you complete the short rest without interruption:   

- Roll your HD and recover that many HP
- Remove 1 point of physical drain and 1 point of mental drain
- A spellcaster may recover one exhausted (but not inaccessible) spell OR [[spells known#prepared spells|prepare]] a replacement spell for a single non-exhausted spell
- Recover any other abilities that return on a short rest. 

##### long rest

If you successfully complete a long rest:  

- Recover all HP
- Remove all physical and mental drain
- Remove 1d4 life drain
- Spellcasters recover all exhausted (but not inaccessible) spells
- Reduce the value of any temporary [[injury|injuries]] by 1.
- Recover any other uses that return on a short rest or long rest

### excursions

Sometimes, the party will venture deep into the wilds or some other inhospitable domain. On such excursions, while under the general wear of long travel or the uncertainty of finding the next safe haven, the party's rests become less productive:

- A **hour's rest** provides only a **brief rest**.
- A **night's rest** provides only a **short rest**

For a night's rest to provide as a long rest, it must be taken in a safe haven (as defined by the GM).

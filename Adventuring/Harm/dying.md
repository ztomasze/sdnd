When most monsters are reduced to 0 hp, they simply die. 

When a character is reduced to 0 [[hit points|hp]], they may start **dying**, as follows.

### 0 hp

 When a character is reduced to 0 hp, they fall [[unconscious]]. They remain unconscious until they heal 1 hp.

### wounds

Any remaining damage beyond what drops a character to 0 hp, or any new sources of damage applied while at 0 hp, are applied as life [[drain]]. This is known as taking a **wound**. Each time you take a wound, you start **dying**.

A player character can choose to take an [[injury]] in place of a wound.

### dying

At the start of your turn while dying, make a [[pure chance|luck roll]] (also called a **death save**):

- **S:** You live on for another round.
	- **CS:** You heal 1 hp
- **F:** You take 1d4 life drain
	- **CF:** You die.

If you make three successful saves (even if they are non-consecutive), you become **stable**.

>**Option: Safer dying**  
>If you'd rather have going down be less dangerous, use:  
> - F: 1 life drain  
> - CF: 1d4 life drain  

### stabilizing

You can spend an action to make an INT or WIS (Medicine) check to stabilize an adjacent dying creature. On a success, the creature is now stable

### stable

When you are stable, you are still at 0 hp and unconscious, but you are no longer dying.  

Typically an hour's [[resting|rest]] means you will heal 1 hp and wake up again.

Wounds, illness, poisons, effects, and some creatures can deal **drain**.

There are three separate types of drain. Separately track the amount of drain you have received for each type. 

* For every 2 points of drain, you are a -1 to [[check|checks]] of the ability scores affected by that drain type.  You suffer only the single highest drain penalty.
* If your drain ever equals or exceeds the highest ability score that is tied to that drain type, you are **debilitated**.  The effect of that debilitation depends on the drain type.  You can be debilitated in more than one drain type at a time.

> **Example**  
> A character takes 4 physical drain. They are now at -2 to all STR and DEX rolls. 
> 
> They then take 6 life drain. This puts them at -3 to all ability rolls. Their STR and DEX rolls are at -3 because the penalties of different drain types do not stack. 
> 
> The character then takes 7 more physical drain, for a total of 11.  They are now at -5 to STR and DEX rolls. They have 10 Strength and 12 Dexterity.  If they take one more point of physical drain, they will be paralyzed.

When you take a [[dying#wounds|wound]] and do not yet have three injuries, you can convert a wound into an **injury**: 

* This reduces the wound to 0 life drain (which means you do not start dying). 
* The resulting injury has a value equal to the drain prevented. 

An injury cannot prevent drain >= your Constitution; you're just dead in that case.

Roll 1d12 on the table below to generate the corresponding injury, or the GM can assign an injury based on the context. You can receive the same injury twice, but roll again if you get it a third time.

Then make a luck roll with a DC equal to the injury's value: 

- **S:** The injury is temporary
- **F:** The injury is permanent

You suffer the injury's effects for as long as you have the injury. A temporary injury persists for a number of days equal to its value. Temporarily or permanent injuries can be removed with the Regeneration spell.

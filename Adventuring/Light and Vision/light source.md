A **light source** produces an [[areas|area]] of [[light|bright light]], centered on the source, of a radius specific to the source. Characters can clearly see things that lie within this illuminated area but cannot see things beyond it.Â  

Examples include a candle (10' radius), torch (30' radius), or lantern (60' radius).

Unless otherwise noted, a light source lasts for one [[real hour]].  

If a light source is placed on the ground, its illumination area is reduced by one step.  For example, a dropped torch only illuminates a 15' radius area.

While light sources do not clearly illuminate very far, they can seen through the darkness from a great distance.

A **Light source** produces an [[areas|area]] of [[light|bright light]] centered on the source of a size specific to the source. Characters can clearly see things that lie within this illuminated area but cannot see things beyond it.Â  

Examples include a candle (adjacent-radius area), torch (near-radius area), or lantern (midrange-radius area).

Unless otherwise noted, a light source lasts for one [[real hour]].  

If a light source is placed on the ground, its illumination area is reduced by one step.  For example, a dropped torch only illuminates a close-radius area.

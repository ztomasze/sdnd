Essential for character [[vision]].

Light come in 4 levels:
##### darkness
The absence of any light.
##### dim
Certain locations, such as a starlit night, a phosphorescent cave, or a dark room illuminated only by dying embers of a forge, might provide enough light to see outlines but little more. Without an alternative light source, this dimness imposes disadvantage on Perception checks and possibly also obscurement to attacks.  
##### bright
Any light strong enough to see clearly.  Depending on the [[light source]], the area in which you can see clearly may be smaller or larger.
##### sunlight
Sunlight is bright light that can have a special effect on certain monsters.  The sunlight may need to be direct in order to be fully effective. Heavy cloud cover or standing in the shade on a sunny day may reduce this to bright light (daylight).

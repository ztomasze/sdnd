A combat comprises of one or more **combat [[round|rounds]]**.

### turn

Each round, each active creature (character or monster) gets one **turn** to act.

During their turn, a creature can perform one [[action|major action]] + one [[action|minor action]] in either order. They can also perform a reasonable number of [[free action|free actions]].

### phases

Within the round, turns are grouped into two **phases**:

1. Monsters - Monsters take their turns
2. Characters - Each player character takes a turn  

Within the monster phase, the GM determines the order of monsters' turns. This can vary from round to round.

During the character phase, the default ordering of turns is per player going clockwise around the table from the GM's left. However, players can agree on a different order during a round if they choose.

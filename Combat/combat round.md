A combat [[scene]] comprises of one or more **combat [[round|rounds]]**.

### turn

Each round, each active creature (character or monster) gets one **turn** to act.

During their turn, a creature can perform one [[action|standard action]] + one [[action|minor action]] in either order. They can also perform a reasonable number of [[free action|free actions]].

* The first round of combat might be a [[surprise|surprise round]]. This short round allows fewer actions.

### duration

As a duration, a combat round extends from the current creature's turn until the start of their next turn after passing through all other combatants in [[initiative]] order.

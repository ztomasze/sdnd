The GM determines whether one side has surprised the other. 

First, surprise changes the [[Combat/initiative]] order for the first [[combat round]]:

* If **both** or **neither** side is surprised, the normal initiative rules are used.
* If **characters surprise monsters**, all characters automatically succeed their initiative rolls.
* If **monsters surprise characters**, all characters automatically fail their initiative rolls.  However, monsters can perform only a single [[action]] during their first turn. 

Second, surprised creatures are [[unaware]] of their opponents until their first turn.  

Surprised characters make a DEX save at the start of the round. On a success, they react fast enough to be aware of their opponents from the start of the round (but their initiative does not change). 

Setting up an effective ambush often involves [[hiding]] first.


> **Option: Both surprised**  
> Alternatively, players roll initiative, but all creatures can only perform a single action this turn.  Characters that succeed on initiative act first, then all monsters, then any characters the failed on initiative.

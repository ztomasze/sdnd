The GM determines whether one side has surprised the other. 

If there is some doubt, individuals on the surprised side might get a chance to make a roll to avoid being surprised. Common examples of this include a WIS(Perception) check against an attacker's stealth in an ambush situation or a WIS(Insight) check against an attacker's deception in a sudden betrayal situation.

### surprise round

If at least one combatant is surprised and at least one combatant is not, the first [[combat round|round of combat]] is a **surprise round**:

* Roll [[initiative]] only for the non-surprised combatants
* Surprised combatants are [[unaware]] for this round
* On their turn, a combatant may only perform a standard [[action]] and free actions (but no minor action unless it is in place of their standard action)

At the end of the surprise round, roll initiative for any surprised combatants. Combat then proceeds normally for future rounds.

You can use your [[Move]] to direct your mount or vehicle to move on your turn. In this case, the mount takes no actions.

Alternatively, you can allow your mount to take its own separate turn, acting according to its nature, possibly influenced by your verbal command (as a [[free action]]). You may need to [[Ready]] your action if you want to coordinate it with your mount's movement or action.

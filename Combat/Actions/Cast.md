> A [[action|standard action]] (usually)

Cast a spell.  See [[magic]] for more context.

### verbal and somatic components

To cast a spell, you must be able to speak clearly and gesture freely with at least one hand. 

* You can use this same hand to then direct the spell or touch a target.

### casting time

Spell casting is not always a standard [[action]]. A spell may take the following amount of time to cast:

- **Action** - Most spells take a single standard action to cast.
- **Minor** - This spell can be cast as a minor action.
- **Reaction** - This spell can be cast in response to a trigger stated in its description.
- **Scene** - This spell takes at least a minute of uninterrupted ritual preparation before it can be cast.

### concentration

You must concentrate for the duration of the casting time. If your [[concentration]] is interrupted--such as by a readied attack--you must make a concentration save to continue casting.

### target
  
Unless otherwise stated in a spell, you must be able to see your target to affect it, whether it is a creature, object, or point in space. 

* If a spell requires you to touch your target, you do not also need to be able to see it. However, you must still know its exact location.

### range

The **range** of the spell specifies the max distance to a target.  In addition to the [[distance]] categories already defined, spell ranges include:

- **Self** - Only the caster is affected.
- **Touch** - As 5' (adjacent) but the caster must also touch the target. This can be done automatically as part of casting the spell using the same hand used to produce the spell's gestures.

The size of any produced [[areas|area]] of effect is specified in the spell's description.

### spellcasting roll

A spellcasting roll is an ability roll using your spellcasting ability.  

* You select your spellcasting ability from the options allowed by your class; you cannot change this choice later.   

The DC to cast a spell is 10 + the spell’s tier:

- **S:** The spell effect happens.
	- **CS:** Thanks to a surge of controlled magic, you can recover one exhausted spell of the same or lower tier.
- **F:** Nothing happens and the spell is **exhausted**: You cannot cast that spell again until you complete a long rest.
	- **CF:** You also suffer a **mishap**, as determined by your magic tradition.

### sure cast

A caster can choose to channel more magical power into a spell for greater control over its outcome but at the expense of burning the spell from their mind. 

Instead of rolling, you can take 10 on your spellcasting roll. That spell is then **exhausted**.

### modifiers

Some spells have a modifier that changes how they are cast:

* [[rote]]

### duration

Once the spell has been cast, it will last for one of the defined durations:

* [[instant]]
* [[combat round]]
* [[scene]]
* [[concentration]]
* [[real hour]]
* [[day]]
* [[permanent]]

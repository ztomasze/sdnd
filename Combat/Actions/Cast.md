> A [[action|major action]] (usually)

Cast a spell.  See [[magic]] for more context.

### verbal and somatic components

To cast a spell, you must be able to speak clearly and gesture freely with at least one hand. 

* You can use this same hand to then direct the spell or touch a target.

### casting time

Spell casting is not always a major [[action]]. A spell may take the following amount of time to cast:

- **Action** - Most spells take a single major action to cast.
- **Minor** - This spell can be cast as a minor action.
- **Reaction** - This spell can be cast in response to a trigger stated in its description.
- **Scene** - This spell takes at least a minute of uninterrupted ritual preparation before it can be cast

### target
  
Unless otherwise stated in a spell, you must be able to see your target to affect it, whether it is a creature, object, or point in space. 

* If a spell requires you to touch your target, you do not also need to be able to see it.

### range

The **range** of the spell specifies the max distance to a target.  In addition to the [[distance]] categories already defined, spell ranges include:

- **Self** - Only the caster is affected.
- **Touch** - As adjacent but the caster must also touch the target.  

The size of any produced [[areas|area]] of effect then be specified in the spell's description.

### spellcasting roll

A spellcasting roll  is an ability roll using your spellcasting ability.  

* You select your spellcasting ability from the options allowed by your class; you cannot change this choice later.   

The DC to cast a spell is 10 + the spell’s tier:

- **S:** The spell effect happens.
	- **CS:** Thanks to a surge of magic, you can recover one exhausted spell of the same or lower tier.
- **F:** Nothing happens and the spell is **exhausted**: You cannot cast that spell again until you complete a long rest.
	- **CF:** You also suffer a **mishap**, as determined by your magic tradition.

### modifiers

Some spells have a modifier that changes how they are cast:

* [[reliable]]
* [[rote]]

### duration

Once the spell has been cast, it will last for one of the defined durations:

* [[instant]]
* [[round]]
* [[scene]]
* [[focus]]
* [[real hour]]
* [[day]]
* [[permanent]]

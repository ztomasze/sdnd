> A [[action|standard action]]

Use an item, such as a scroll, wand, potion, etc.Â  

This is also used for significant interactions with the environment, such as picking locks, cranking wheels, flipping heavy tables, and shoving the tops off of sarcophagi.

* Especially in the time pressure of combat, some might require an ability check.

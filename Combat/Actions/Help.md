> A [[action|major action]]
 
You **aid** an ally or **distract** an enemy. 

Narrate how you are doing this in the current context, such as by defending your ally's flank, throwing sand in an enemy's face, pushing an enemy off-balance from behind, etc. The GM is the arbitrator of whether such help is currently possible or effective. 

In general:
* Aiding an adjacent ally or distracting an adjacent enemy is automatic (with an adequate narrative explanation). 
* Operating from a near distance might be possible with an ability roll, such as making a CHA(Performance) roll to blather or taunt well enough to distract a nearby enemy.

### aid

Grant an ally a [[boon]].Â 

### distract

Give an enemy a [[bane]].

> A [[action|minor action]]

Briefly or quickly interact with an object.  

Examples include draw a potion vial from your belt pouch, push open an unlocked door, grab hold of a fallen ally, snatch a torch out of a sconce, or sheathe a sword. The GM will tell you if the interaction is complicated enough to require a full [[Use]] action.Â 

### on the move

Manipulating an object is simple enough that you can combine it with a [[Move]] as a single minor action. 

This requires that your movement also be simple, such as walking over level ground.  You cannot manipulate an object on the move if you need to climb, watch your footing over difficult terrain, or otherwise pay more attention to your movement than normal.

> A [[action|major action]]

Certain spells or magic items may require you to spend an action in concentration to direct their effect.

If you are currently focusing on a [[focus]] spell, you can use this action to grant yourself advantage on any focus rolls made this turn, including the one made at the start of your turn for a focus-per-round spell.

> A [[action|standard action]]

A grapple is a catch-all for any assault that grabs, pushes, shoves, or otherwise aims to aggressively affect another creature in ways other than dealing damage. (Some grapples, especially by monsters, may still inflict damage as a secondary effect.)

### hands required

Unless otherwise noted, initiating a grapple requires two free hands. You can attempt to start a grapple with only one free hand at disadvantage.  (Exceptions include grappling with a weapon like a garrote or a monster using one of its many tentacles.)

You must touch your opponent, so you can't grapple an incorporeal creature, and you will likely take some damage if you try grappling a fire elemental or a porcupine.

### grapple

In its most basic form, you attempt to grab, hold, and restrain your target.

* Contest your STR(Athletics) with the target's choice of STR(Athletics) or DEX(Acrobatics)

If one participant is a monster, they use their normal attack modifier. Against a character, this can be static, which means this becomes a test DC 10+HD.

* As with any attack, other modifiers may apply, depending on the situation.

If you succeed, you are now hanging onto your target with however many hands (or weapon) you used to start the grapple.

* Your target is your size, they are is generally restrained and can't move away without a STR contest to drag you along.
* If they are one or more categories smaller, you can probably pick them up.
* If they are one or more categories larger, you can probably only hanging onto them, though this will likely still impede their movements and combat actions.

### climb onto

If you grapple a creature two sizes larger than you, you may be able to climb up them now that you have a grip. 

If such a creature can reach you, it generally only takes an uncontested Manipulate action to pluck you off.

### disarm

Instead of grappling to hold on, you can instead attempt to wrest free a weapon or other item from their grip or pull another readily available item from their person. 

If you aim to disarm the target of a weapon, you can make this test using an attack roll with an appropriate melee weapon instead.  On a CS, you can choose to sunder (break) their weapon or held item.

### shove (bull rush)

push back a step

### squeeze

Once you have established a grapple, you can repeat the check in a subsequent action to deal your unarmed or natural weapon damage to your target. 

### tackle (overbear)

Resolve as per **grapple**, but on a failure you end up prone and on a success both you and your target end up prone. If you Move toward your target immediately before the tackle, you get gain advantage on the grapple check.

### trip

pull rider from mount.
trip with weapon, dropping weapon on a failure


# bypass
### overrun

push past or knock down
act during move (as exception)
oppenent can just let you by instead
if mounted, mount makes the check

CS: deal an unarmed (or hoof or equivalent for mount) attack

On success, move into the larger creature's space, hang one, be moved with it, and have advantage on attacks on it.  Can move around on larger creatures as difficult terrain. Larger creatures can typically spend an action to make a Grapple check to try to dislodge you

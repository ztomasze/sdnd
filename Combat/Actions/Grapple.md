> A [[action|standard action]]

A **grapple** is a catch-all for any assault that grabs, pushes, shoves, or otherwise aims to aggressively affect another creature in ways other than dealing damage. (Some grapples, especially by monsters, may still inflict damage as a secondary effect.)

### hands required

Unless otherwise noted, initiating a grapple requires two free hands.

* You can attempt to start a grapple with only one free hand at disadvantage.  
* Exceptions include grappling with a weapon like a garrote or a monster using one of its many tentacles.

You must touch your opponent, so you can't grapple an incorporeal creature, and you will likely take some damage if you try grappling a fire elemental or a porcupine.

### grapple

In its most basic form, you attempt to grab, hold, and restrain your target.  

Resolve this as a melee [[contest]]: 

* The attacker rolls a STR-based melee attack roll. 
	* Add half of your expertise in Athletics. 
* The defender can choose to roll either a STR-based or DEX-based melee attack roll. 
	* If using STR: Add half of your expertise in Athletics. Gain advantage if you are a size larger than the attacker or disadvantage if you are smaller.
	* If using DEX: Add half your expertise in Acrobatics.
* Monsters use their normal attack rolls. 
	* Against a character, this can be static, which means this becomes a test vs DC 10+HD. They gain +4 or -4 if they have advantage or disadvantage.
* As with any attack, other modifiers may apply, depending on the situation.

A tie means the current states persist: No grapple is established if youâ€™re trying to create one or the grapple purse if you were trying to break one. 

If you win as the attacker, you are now hanging onto your target with however many hands (or weapon) you used to start the grapple.

* If your target is your size, they are generally grabbed ([[impeded]]) if you used one hand or [[restrained]] if you used two and can't move away.
* If they are one or more categories smaller, you can probably pick them up.
* If they are one or more categories larger, you can probably only hang onto them, though this will likely still [[impeded|impede]] their movements and combat actions.
* You can let go at any time to end the grapple.

### climb onto

If you grapple a creature two sizes larger than you, you may be able to climb up them now that you have a grip. 

If such a creature can reach you, it generally only takes an uncontested Manipulate action to pluck you off.

### disarm

Instead of grappling to hold on, you can instead attempt to wrest a weapon or other item from their grip or pull another readily available item from their person. They have advantage if they are holding the item with two hands.

If you aim to disarm the target of a weapon, you can make this test using an attack roll with an appropriate melee weapon instead.  On a CS, you can choose to sunder (break) their weapon or held item (if that is feasible with your weapon).

### overrun

You can can perform this action in the middle of a Move. Instead of grappling to hold on, you simply try to push past. Both the attacker and defender must use STR. If you are mounted, your mount makes the check. On a failure, your move ends just before the defender. (See also: tumble)

### shove (bull rush)

Instead of grappling to hold on, you can push the target 5' back on a success. If you Move toward your target immediately before the shove, you gain advantage on this contest.

### squeeze

Once you have established a grapple, you can repeat the grapple contest in a subsequent action to deal your unarmed or natural weapon damage to your target. 

### tackle (overbear)

You attempt to drag your foe to the ground while you grapple them. Resolve as per a grapple. On a failure you end up prone. On a success, both you and your target end up prone (as well as the normal grapple effects). 

If you Move toward your target immediately before the tackle, you gain advantage on this contest.

### trip

Instead of grappling to hold on, on a success you knock the defender prone.  You can also use to this to pull a rider from their mount.  You can can trip with some weapons, but you drop the weapon on a CF.

### tumble

You can can perform this action in the middle of a Move. Instead of grappling to hold on, you can through the defender's square. Both the attacker and defender must use DEX. You cannot take this action while mounted. On a failure, your move ends just before the defender.  (See also: overrun)

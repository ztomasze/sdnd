> A special [[free action]]

Immediately after the start of your turn (and any effects that happen then), but before taking any other action, you can choose to delay.  

* Adjust your initiative to a value of your choice.  You take no more actions now.
* When your turn comes around again at the new initiative value, skip any "start of your turn" effects if it has not been a full [[combat round]] since your first delay.

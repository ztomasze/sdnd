> A [[action|minor action]]

Try to locate an invisible or hidden creature or feature. 

If you are searching the right area and in an effective way (listening, looking for footprints in the sand, etc), make a WIS(Perception) check or a WIS(Perception)-vs-DEX(Stealth) contest. 

This quick search can't find everything, though.Â  For example, an immobile invisible creature might not be discoverable this way.

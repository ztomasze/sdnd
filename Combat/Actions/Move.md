> A [[action|minor action]]

You move up to a near [[distance]], with some caveats.

### speed

Some monsters move faster or slower than characters, so they might move only very near or to midrange with a single move.

### movement mode

Monsters or characters affected by magic might also have other movement modes, such as flying, running along walls, or burrowing under the ground.  Similarly, you can use your movement for other kinds of movement besides walking or running, such as climbing, crawling, swimming, etc. 

You can also use your move to stand up, to mount or dismount a suitable riding creature, to row a boat, to direct a mount to move, or other similar movement.

### free disengage

There are no attacks of opportunity, retreat, or withdraw requirements. You can turn and run just as freely as the six-fingered man ran from Inigo.

### difficult terrain

If you are passing over uneven or treacherous ground, you move at half your normal speed. 

The nature of the hazard will have different implications.  For example, there's not much you can do about thick mud or thigh-deep snow other than just wade through it.  On the other hand, when traversing slick ice or a narrow beam, you might be able to make a DEX check to cross at full speed. However, expect a cost on a F or CF for such checks, such as making no progress at all, gaining a [[bane]], falling prone, taking damage, etc.

### past other creatures

Moving through an occupied space is treated as difficult terrain.

* You can move through or past a willing ally without a check. 
* To move through a tiny space occupied by an enemy that doesn't want to let you pass, you can contest STR vs STR to shove past or DEX vs STR to dart around.

### climbing and swimming

This typically means moving at half speed, as per difficult terrain. If the climb is particularly treacherous or the water particularly rough, a STR or DEX check may be necessary to make any progress at all. On a CF, you either fall or start to drown.

### object interaction

During your move, you can make one quick object interaction, such as push open an unlocked door, grab hold of a fallen ally, snatch a torch out of a sconce, or sheathe a sword. The GM will tell you if the interaction is complicated enough to require a full [[Use]] action. 

### uninterrupted movement

Taking an [[action]] ends your movement. You cannot move a few steps, act, and then continue to move.  (But see [[Rush]].)

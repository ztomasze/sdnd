During your turn, you can perform a reasonable number of free actions.  

A **free action** is a movement that is so quick and simple that it can be done in less than a second or in combination with any other action.  

Examples include:

* Drop a held item
* End focus on a spell
* Speak a sentence or two, such as issuing a command or making a request.  (You should not expect a reply during the same turn, so you cannot hold a conversation this way.)
* Fall prone

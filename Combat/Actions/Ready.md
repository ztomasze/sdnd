> A [[action|major action]]

Hold a stated action until you perceive a stated trigger. You can then interrupt the triggering action as a [[action#reactions|reaction]] if you can perceive it in time. 

For example, you can typically interrupt the casting of a spell or an attack with a readied attack. However, if the creature is invisible, you cannot interrupt its attack, although readying may still be valuable so you can immediately attack it back before it has a chance to move from its location.

You can hold a readied action until the start of your next turn.

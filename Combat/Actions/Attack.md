> A [[action|major action]]

Make a weapon attack. 

### in hand

You need the requisite weapon in hand, so you may need to [[Manipulate]] to draw it first. You can freely draw any ammo needed from a quiver.

### target's location

To attack a target, you must first know its location. If you can’t see it and can’t pinpoint it through other precise senses (such as echolocation), you can [[Search]] to try to locate it based on imprecise senses (such as hearing). Otherwise, you can simply guess where your target is. Even if you guess or use imprecise sense to successfully locate the target, it is still [[#obscurement|obscured]].

### range

The target must be within range of your weapon. 

* For a melee weapon attack, this is usually adjacent. 
* For a thrown or ranged weapon, this depends on the range of the specific weapon.

See [[weapons]] for more details, such as situations where you must make ranged attacks at disadvantage.

### attack roll  

Make an [[check|ability check]] appropriate to your [[weapons|weapon]]. 

* This is typically STR for a melee weapon, your choice of STR or DEX for a finesse or thrown weapon, or DEX for a ranged weapon. 

The DC for this check equals the AC of your target (which can be modified by [[#cover]]):

- **S:** You hit your target and deal damage equal to a roll of the weapon’s damage die.  
	* This might include additional dice from talents such as [[sneak attack]] or an magical augment such as flaming weapon. You do not add an ability modifier to the damage. See [[damage]] for more.
	- **CS:** You hit your target, regardless of its AC. If you would have already hit your target, either add a second roll of your weapon's damage dice OR impose 1 [[bane]] on the target.
- **F:** You miss and deal no damage.
    - **CF:** You miss your target, regardless of its AC. If you already would have missed, you also overstep or otherwise leave yourself vulnerable: Gain 1 [[bane]].
    
### cover

If your target’s body is partly behind a solid obstacle, they gain +2 AC for half cover or +5 AC for three-quarters or more cover.  This same bonus also applies to DEX saves versus any effect that pass over the cover. 

If your target has total cover, you can’t usually attack them (unless you have an attack that can extend around corners like a fireball or a punch through thin cover like a woven mat wall). 

Other creatures provide cover. This is typically +2 AC, but multiple or very large interposing figures could grant more.

### obscurement

If you can’t clearly see the outline of your target, such as due to darkness, foliage, fog, or invisibility, you attack at disadvantage.

### non-lethal

If you are wielding a bludgeoning weapon--like your fists, a club, sap, staff, etc--you can choose to leave your target unconscious, stable, and alive when they hit 0 hp.  

You may also be able to attack with the flat of your blade, a sheathed sword, or the haft of your weapon, but such attacks deal at most 1d4 damage.

### coup de grace

If your target is unconscious or similarly immobile and you have an appropriate weapon, you can kill it without making a roll. For example, you might be able to stake a slumbering vampire or slit an unconscious goblin's throat, but you probably can't slay a sleeping adult dragon with one thrust of a dagger.

### two-weapon fighting

You can fight with one club, dagger, hammer, handaxe, shortsword or other GM-allowed weapon in each hand. Gain finesse on your attack only if both weapons have the property. On a hit, roll both weapon damage dice and take the better result.

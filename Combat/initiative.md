Combat typically starts with player characters rolling **initiative** (although [[surprise]] can change this).

To roll initiative, make a DEX [[check]].

Each character that succeeds this check can perform a single [[action]] at the start of the first round, before the monster [[combat round#phases|phase]].  This can be done either in an order of those characters' choosing or in descending order of the initiative result.

Those characters then take their normal full turn at the end of character phase, after any characters that failed their initiative check.

Subsequent [[combat round|combat rounds]] proceed normally.

Combat typically starts with player characters rolling **initiative**.

To roll initiative, characters make a DEX [[check]].  

* Monsters either act at 11 or the GM can make a [[pure chance|luck roll]] for each group of equivalent monsters.

Creatures act in order, counting down from highest result to lowest. In every round that follows, the characters act in the same order unless a creature chooses to [[Delay]] their turn.

In the case of a tied initiative count:

* Player characters act before monsters.
* Tied allies can choose the order of their turns during the first round.

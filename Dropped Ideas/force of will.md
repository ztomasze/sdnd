### force of will

Sometimes, when a spell goes awry, a caster can maintain a mental grip on the fraying strands of magic just long enough to wring out an effect, although such strain always imparts a mental toll. 

When you fail a spellcasting roll while casting a spell, you can choose to take 1 point of [[drain|mental drain]] to still produce the spell's normal effect.Â  The spell then exhausted as normal, and you incur the usual mishap in the case of a critical failure.

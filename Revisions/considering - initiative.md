#### inputs

From **Shadowdark**:

* Use (casual) rounds at all times, so everyone gets a chance to act

From **Angry GM**:

* Use an Action Queue.  Even if players Declare multiple actions, you can Declare-Determine-Describe one at a time. Check in with others, so that you actually have an Action Queue going for each character. You should know where everyone is and what they are doing, even if that's just waiting.
* Initiative is a tool that is only necessary when you need to resolve the order of simultaneous ("bullet time") action.  Don't roll initiative and constrain yourself to that until you need it.  (His example uses 5e-style initiative, but people roll in as they join the comobat)

From **2e** (and B/X, etc):  When an encounter starts, before rolling init, you can:

* Flee
* Talk
* Wait
* Fight (and if you do this every time, you're doing it wrong)
* (Other)

From **2e**:

1. Declare actions
2. Roll initiative
3. Resolve actions

From my last **playtest session**: 

* We encountered some bandits in a cabin. We failed our Stealth rolls, so they were not surprised.  They attacked us (cause the adventure said they would) and fought to the death.
* There should be a more seemless flow into combat, and I'm still not settled on my surprise rules.
* Actions were kind of long.  
	* I wanted to support "I step back, draw my shield, and defend", all during a "one action" surprise round. Currently you can only draw a shield as part of a Move, so that wasn't possible. 
	* I'm also tempted to add a free "5 foot step"
	* So I'm getting up to standard action + minor action + adjustment + free actions. 
	* That means I've lost the inspiration/focus I had a month ago: 
		* As in PF2e, an action is an action.
		* But instead of 3 (as APs) per turn, we'll just do one and go around table faster!
	* The problem with that is that some actions are either small or boring.  
		* This pushes me to towards the more modern "standard action"

From my **first Dargrim session**:

* I was running a 5e combat with 6 NPCs in one wagon, 3 in another, a couple animals, and 4 PCs.  While my brain was full dealing with narration, effect resolution, and the overall flow the battle, I had few mental cycles left.
* A consistent ordered initiative tracker was actually a tool here.  It made sure I covered everyone every round.  (I forgot to put the animals in the tracker and thus didn't narrate what I intended to cover about the mule still hitched to the toppled wagon.)
	* So this is not really broken.  It may need to be more flexible in certain ways--such as how characters get added to it, how easy it is to then adjust position in initiative to promote collaboration, and still allowing groups at the same initiative.
* I don't think I'd be able to hold the announced plans of 4 PCs + 12 NPCs in my head and then correctly adjudicate them all.
	* Maybe that's a problem with the size of the combat I'm running... but my tools should scale when needed.  And large combats have happened through the game's history, either on the NPC side or the size of the party (with old modules suggesting to 5 to 8 PCs is a good number).

From a **Declare-Resolve 5e house rule** trial:

* I tried this out for a couple sessions several years ago. In brief, players had to declare their actions at the start of each round and could adjust initiative in that round, and then we resolved in order.
* My conclusion then was it added some complication, but the benefit wasn't worth it.

##### thoughts

On **Actions**:

* If I went back to one action at a time, it'd be easier to mentally adjudicate the Action Queue for everyone, regardless of the time frame (exploration vs combat rounds).
* However, after reviewing the list, I still keep getting pulled to being at least allow move+attack.  And draw+attack. 
* I could go back to at least move+Action by dropping all the Minor actions I've defined at this point (Aim, Load, Maneuver, Recover, Search, some spells as minor action)...
* But I think instead I'm just going to tweak object interaction to be an actual minor action (combineable with move) and add a free 5' step.  It's a little more complicated for sure, but I think I do want a little bit more complexity.

On **Initiative**:

* This is a favorite thing to house rule because there are always sharp edges. You're using a system to sequentialize events that are supposed to be occurring simultaneously in the game world. So something always feels off about it.
* While there are some interesting mechanical things you can do here--individual vs group initiative, popcorn initiative (so there's some strategy on when you choose to let a monster go), weapon/spell factors (so the type of action you perform impacts the initiative), etc--I don't think I'm personally looking for a mini-game around this.  I just want a tool to 1) adjudicate what happens when and 2) (as I realized recently) take some of the tracking burden out of my head.
* It should still be flexible enough to allow for player collaboration, and the GM should be able to process a bunch of creatures together when that's faster/easier rather than having to go one-by-one in the same order every round.
* Once you're in the heat of battle, the initiative tracker feels less confining.  Where it does feel restrictive is:
	1. Getting into initiative (turning the encounter into a fight)
	2. Getting out of initiative (when you want to flee, wind down, etc.)

On **Surprise**:

* My current rules (an extra half-phase at the start) still feels a little stilted...
* But after re-reading, I think I'm just not used to it yet.
	* GM is supposed to determine surprise.  That could be a Perception roll or not.
	* Then there's a roll just to determine whether you're unaware or not during that round.
* That second part could be handled by initiative if I went back to rolling individual initiative: You're unaware until your first turn.
* But I also have ideas floating around in my head of things like: "Ambush! Arrows fly through the air..."  Do those just hit?  What about something like a DEX(Perception) save to avoid them?  Really, they're just an attack (at advantage if the party is unaware).

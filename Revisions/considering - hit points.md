Current HP is based on original sources, but it still does end up with lot of HP. 

Using OSE as starting point, dragons and giants have 10 to 15 HD (d8s).  A level 10 fighter matches the lower bound of htis, and with 2 x Improved HD givng 10d12 hp, would match the upper bound.  A giant or dragon should equal the whole party in HP!  

But I still like the reroll idea, and I dislike getting stuck with bad rolls.

What might I do instead?

* Gain the average every level, but still use HD for recovery.
* Use d4, d4+1, d4+2, d4+3, and d4+4 in place of d4, d6, d8, d10, and d12, respectively.
* Stop gaining HD at level 6+
	* Maybe everyone gains d4 from then on?
	* Or just flat benefit each level, like levels 10+ in 2e.

**Conclusion:** Going with the last option.

> A [[action|standard action]]

Give considerable attention to a mental effort. Certain spells or magic items may require you to spend an action in concentration to direct their effect.

If you are currently focusing on a [[concentration]] spell, you can use this action to grant yourself advantage on any focus rolls made this turn, including the one made at the start of your turn for a focus-per-round spell.

> And from [[concentration]] (previously **focus**):

### focus per turn

For effects with this duration, you must make a focus roll at the start of each of your turns to maintain the spell. (The [[Concentrate]] action can help you here.)

> Part of [[boons and banes]]

A **malediction** represents a supernatural hex, curse, or execration.

When a creature has a malediction:

- the next [[check|ability check]] rolled by that creature gains -d4.  This includes attacks, saves, and skills.

Maledictions interact with other boons and banes as follows:

* A benediction automatically cancels a malediction and vice versa.
* A benediction can stack with a bane, and both can apply to the same roll.

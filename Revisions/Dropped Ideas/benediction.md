> Part of [[boons and banes]]

A **benediction** represents supernatural guidance or protection.

When a creature has a benediction:

- the next [[check|ability check]] rolled by that creature gains +d4.  This includes attacks, saves, and skills.

Benedictions interact with other boons and banes as follows:

* A malediction automatically cancels a benediction and vice versa.
* A benediction can stack with a boon, and both can apply to the same roll.

Magic items include [[scroll|scrolls]], [[wand|wands]], [[potion|potions]], and [[wondrous item|wondrous items]].

### identifying

*Detect magic* is the most common way to realize you have a magic item on hand. Other times, you might guess that an item is likely magical based on its form (scroll, wand, vial of liquid, etc) or function (a sword that glows faintly when you pick it up).  

The next step is to discern its exact properties.  There are a few ways to do this.

##### *identify*

The *identify* spell is the most reliable means. The spell reveals all normal functional properties of the item, as well as most illusions, magical masks, and curses.  It may not reveal artifact-level properties or that an item is intelligent. When *identify* fails to reveal one or more properties, the caster will at least know there is something more, but not the details or nature of the additional features.

Even if no one in your party can cast *identify*, you may be able to purchase such spellcasting services in some settlements.

##### experimentation

Otherwise, you can experiment with the item:

* Sipping a **potion** will reveal its properties.
* Wearing or experimenting with a **wondrous item** might give you a clue to it's function.  For example, you might feel lighter on your feet when you don *boots of leaping*. Your companions may notice you disappear when you slip on an *ring of invisibility*.  You might realize you have a *bag of holding* when you stick your arm in and can't reach the bottom. 
* Landing an attack with a **weapon** in combat will reveal any +X modifier it has.
* Taking a hit in combat will reveal any +X modifiers an **armor** or a **shield**. 

This approach is not without its risks, however:

* A mere sip of a potion will expose you to any poison or toxin
* Donning a cursed item will expose you to any curse it has.

##### attunement

If an item requires attunement (see below), then attuning to it will reveal its properties and expose you to any curses it has.

##### research

Some legendary items or artifacts might have distinctive features that you can recognize them with an appropriate [[knowledge]] check or be able to research their lore for their powers and activation methods.

### wearing

Magic items must be worn or used in their normal fashion for their magic to function.  For example, you must wear both boots or gloves to benefit from their magical benefits.  Some magic items (especially attuned items) can resize themselves to fit wearers of different sizes.

You can only benefit from one magic item in a given body slot at a time:

- One headband, hat, helmet, or phylactery on the **head**
- One pair of eye lenses or goggles on or over the **eyes**
- One amulet, brooch, medallion, necklace, periapt, or scarab around the **neck**
- One vest, vestment, or shirt on the **torso**
- One robe or suit of armor on the **body** (over a vest, vestment, or shirt)
- One belt around the **waist** (over or under a robe or suit of armor)
- One cloak, cape, or mantle around the **shoulders** and back (over a robe or suit of armor)
- One pair of bracers or bracelets on the **arms** or wrists
- One glove, pair of gloves, or pair ofÂ gauntlets on the **hands**
- One **ring** on each hand 
- One pair of boots or shoes on the **feet**

### attunement

Some magic items require attunement with their wielder to function.  There may be limits, such as class, alignment, or ancestry, on what creatures an item will attune with. A character can attune with a maximum of 3 items.

To attune, the character spends a hour's [[resting|rest]] inspecting, handling, and meditating on the item.  Attuning items crave a magical bond and reveal themselves to an appropriate character trying to form such a bond.

A character cannot voluntarily end attunement with a cursed item.  Otherwise, attunement can be ended by spending another hour's rest to do.  Attunement also ends if the character dies or if another character attempts to attune to the item and the item accepts.

### activation

Most magic items just require you to **use** them normally, such as wearing an article of clothing or swinging a sword.  This includes items like [[potion|potions]] and oils, which much be drunk or poured onto an object.  Using a [[scroll]] or [[wand]] is very much like casting a spell with the item in hand.

Sometimes, a item must be **activated** to produce a given effect. By default, this requires speaking a command word aloud while focusing your attention on the item. You can activate an attuned item mentally instead of verbally. Generally this activation requires a [[Use]] action, but the item will specify if it can be done faster or as part of another action.

A scroll holds a written version of a given spell.  It is imbued with the magic needed to cast the spell with only a few finishing words.

### identify

Before casting the spell, its unique notation must be deciphered. This process also reveals which spell the scroll contains.

This can be done automatically with the *read magic* spell. 

Otherwise, make a spellcasting check + half Arcana versus as DC of 10+spell tier

* **S:** You identify the spell and can use the scroll
* **F:** You cannot attempt to decipher this scroll again until either your spellcasting or Arcana modifier improves.
	* **CF:** You can never decode this particular scroll through this method.

### use

Only a spellcaster or [[Magical Dabbler]] can use a scroll. In the case of a spellcaster, the scroll's spell must be on their class spell list. 

If these requirements are met, you can [[Use]] the scroll to cast the spell it contains.  This is always a standard action even if the particular spell is normally cast faster or slower than this. You must have the scroll in hand, be able to read its text, and be able to speak clearly.

* If you are high enough level to be able to learn the spell, the spell is cast from the scroll automatically (as per [[Cast#sure cast]]). 
* Otherwise, if the spell is of a greater tier than you can cast, you must make a spellcasting check to cast the spell:
	* **F:** The spell is not cast but the scroll is destroyed.
		* **CF:** You also suffer an [[arcane]]-like mishap. 

The spell's effect is based on the scroll's caster level, not your own. Unless otherwise noted, the caster level of a scroll is the minimum necessary to learn and cast that spell.

The scroll is then consumed: It's magical writing vanishes and it cannot be used again.

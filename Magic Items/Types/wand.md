A wand contains the magic of a given spell that can be activated with only a couple words and the right flourish.


[[Cast]].  You must have the wand in hand as part of the spells somatic component and you must speak the command words aloud as part of the verbal component.  You use cannot [[Subtle Spellcasting]] with a wand.

0-tier wands do not require attunement.  All other wands do.

SD&D monsters don't follow the same rules as player characters.  For example, they don't have set ability scores and don't make saves.  Instead, they are defined primarily by their HD, attacks, and special qualities.  This makes them easier for GMs to create, tweak, and run.

### monster features

##### name

##### size

| Size       | Height/Length | HD  | Dmg (default) |
| ---------- | ------------- | --- | ------------- |
| Tiny       | 2' or less    | d4  | d2            |
| Small      | 2' to 4'      | d6  | d4            |
| Medium     | 4' to 7'      | d8  | d6            |
| Large      | 7' to 12'     | d10 | d8            |
| Huge       | 12' to 25'    | d12 | d10           |
| Gargantuan | 25'+          | d20 | d12           |

##### type


##### HD
HD
* 0 HD = 1/2 HD or set hp.  **+Minions!**
* Roll to determine hp on first damage.
* Attacks gain +HD to hit up to +10, then +1 for every 2 HD after that (+11 at 12, +12 at 14, and so on)
* 

HD+X
* +2X hp
* +1 to attack rolls (optional)


##### AC

For monsters, assume:

* 8 = unarmored + slow/easy to hit (zombie, ooze)
* 10 = unarmored
* 12 = leather (light armor)
* 14 = chain (medium armor)
* 16 = plate (heavy armor)
* 18 = plate + shield

##### attacks

Attack: +(HD - 1)
damage favors earlier sources
includes special attacks

{Name}: {+X} {melee/ranged (range)} {dmg}
{special effects}

grapple: As melee.  On hit, starts a grapple. If any damage is listed, deals that damage on hit and can be dealt automatically each turn if the grapple persists.

{Name}: {special attack}
{details}

##### immunity, resistance, and vulnerability

Three lines, always there for consistency


Constructs, undead, and elementals are generally immune to poison or disease given their lack of normal metabolism.  Oozes, plants, celestial, and fiends are also often immune or resistant (save with advantage) to the diseases that affect humanoids.


##### special

special defense or capability.  Detailed in description.

##### movement

##### intelligence

##### disposition

alignment
morale

Morale - as 2e

**Spellcasting**
If innate effect (times per day), it just happens automatically. 

If spellcaster, then make an Easy (DC7) check to cast with no mishap.

**Saves**

* Hard check (DC15)
* Fort: +X if HD+X (up to +4)
* Ref: +2 if speed is faster than Normal; -2 Ref if slower than normal
* Will: +2 Will if human-level intelligence or higher (11+). +2 Will if have spell-like abilities; -2 if animal intelligence (2-)

### conversion

The preferred starting source for SD&D monsters is 2e. However, even in this case, the monsters cannot be used unmodified, and other editions do certain things better. Guidance is given here for migrating your favorite monsters from various retro-clone systems (or the original versions they represent):  OSE (B/X), OSRIC (1e/2e), d20 (3.5), or (5e).
##### preferred conversion

**HD:** Use **2e**, but convert from d8 to HD based on the character's size (above)
* d20 HD is typically equivalent (although the HP will often be higher due to CON bonus)

**AC:** If using 2e, use 19 - AC.
* However, **5e** is preferred.

**Movement:** Translate using the nearest value.

| SD&D          | 2e  | 5e       |
| ------------- | --- | -------- |
| **Adj**       | 1   | **5'**   |
| **Close-**    | 3   | 10'      |
| **Close+**    | 6   | 15'      |
| **Near-**     | 9   | 20'      |
| **Near**      | 12  | **30'**  |
| **Near+**     | 15  | 40'      |
| **Midrange-** | 18  | 50'      |
| **Midrange**  | 24  | **60'**  |
| **Midrange+** | 30  | 80'      |
| **Far-**      | 36  | 90'      |
| **Far**       | 48  | **120'** |
| **Far+**      | 60  | 160'     |
**Attacks:** Use **2e** (but clean up to make more readable)

**Damage:** Use **2e**

**Description:** Use **d20** (3.5e) as this can by copied under the OGL.

### system notes

##### OSE (B/X)

**HD:** Uses d8s, sometimes with a +hp bonus.


##### d20 (3.5e)

**HD:** Varies based on type.  For example, fey use d6, humanoids use d8, and undead use d12. Includes bonus from CON.  Generally follows the same HD values as previous editions.

##### 5e

**HD:** Varies based on creature size, from d4 (Tiny) to d20 (Gargantuan).  Includes bonus from CON. Drastically increases the number of HD.


HP/10 = HD

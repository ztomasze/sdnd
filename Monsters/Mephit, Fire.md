##### Description
Mephits are minor creatures from the elemental planes. All mephits appear as small, winged creatures with more or less humanoid features. While they are often described as impish, their elemental origins are apparent at first glance.  

Fire mephits come from the Elemental Plane of Fire. A fire mephit is 3 to 4 feet tall and weighs about 1 pound. While not truly evil, they are the most mischievous and destructive of all mephits.

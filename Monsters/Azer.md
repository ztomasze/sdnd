##### Description
Azers are dwarflike beings native to the Elemental Plane of Fire. They have metallic bronze bodies, hair and beards of fire, and wear metal kilts or aprons of beaten brass, copper, or bronze.

Although unfriendly and taciturn, azers rarely provoke a fight except to relieve a foe of gems, which they love. 
##### Combat
Azers use broad-headed spears or large well-crafted hammers in combat. Their hammers are versatile when not wearing their large shields. When unarmed, they attempt to grapple foes. 

If threatened, they fight to the death, but they see the value of taking prisoners themselves.

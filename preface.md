_An explanation of where Shadows Dark & Deep came from and what it aims to do._

There is a certain fantasy tabletop roleplaying game that has recently started using the tagline "the world's greatest roleplying game".  In many ways, that's true. The game largely defined the genre in the mid-1970s, and it's probably the roleplaying game that the most people have heard of, even if they don't play such games. It's certainly the game I keep coming back to.  Since that game's name is trademarked (and I don't want to step on that trademark here), I'll simply call it _the source game_.

Creation of _Shadows Dark & Deep_ started when I wandered from the source game to explore many of its retro-clones and imitators. Each brought some fresh ideas to game. Two that particularly stuck with me were _Shadowdark_ and _Shadow of the Demon Lord._ It seems that I like shadowy worlds and gaming systems.

I found _Shadowdark_ fresh for a while, yet, like I said, I keep coming back to the source game. I started house-ruling Shadowdark to feel a little more comfortable, to add a few more options…

Around the same time, the source game released a new version of their 5th edition (5e). It was no longer clear what the authoritative version of that edition was: the 2014 version, the many optional rules and expansions added since then, and/or this new 2024 version. As a game master, I needed to pick and choose which rules worked for me. Which version of the Ranger class am I using? Which version of character backgrounds? The 2014 or 2024 exhaustion rules?  As an inveterate house-ruler and homebrewer, this little nudge was all it took to send me spiraling out of control.

As I outlined the versions of the 5e rules I would be using, I started thinking...

* of previous editions of the source game I'd played (3e and 3.5e)
* of the versions I'd read through (Basic/Expert, 1e, 2e, and 4e)
* of the many retroclones I'd browsed and dabbled in, such as _Old School Essential_, _Basic Fantasy Roleplay_, _Labyrinth Lord_, _Pathfinder_ 1e and 2e, _Lamentations of the Flame Princess_, and _Deathbringer_
* of the more distant fantasy roleplaying games that still stood in the same shadow, such as _Shadowdark_, _Shadow of the Demon Lord_, _The 13th Age_, _DC20_
* and several other systems not listed here (except for you, sweet _Symbaroum_)

If I'm pulling together my preferred rules from different systems, then why not pull them from the entire family tree?

_Shadows Dark & Deep_ is the result of that effort. As always, I've returned to the source game as my guiding light. While a few stray mechanics got pulled in from afar (such as _Shadowdark_'s real-hour timers and roll-to-cast and _SotDL_'s boons and banes, albeit slightly modified), most of the content exists in previous editions of the source game.  Although excited by the simplicity of B/X's characters, but I still want an open range of character archetypes that exceeds even 3.5e and its many prestige classes. I want 5e's clear mechanical monster formats, but I also want 2e's rich flavor, nostalgia, and the simplicity of running monsters based on little more than their HD and AC.  I crave the openness of GM rulings at the table and the fast simple combats promised by early editions, but I also want the clearer core mechanics of later editions to make those rulings easier.

In short, _SD&D_ is the version of the source game I want to run. It's my edition, which pays homage to all of those that came before  Feel free to use it or borrow from it, as I've done to so many systems before me. And to those myriad designers and creators: Thank you!

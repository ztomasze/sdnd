Some effects - especially light sources and some spells - are pegged to the passage of real-world time.  In this case, set one timer for the first, or primary, effect, such as the first torch lit.  Any additional real-hour effects, such as more light sources, ride along on that same timer as secondary effects. 

When the timer ends, the primary effect immediately ends. Any secondary effects end at the end of the current [[Basics/Time/round]]. You can choose to end the current timer early - usually to start a fresh primary effect.

If game time jumps forward an hour or more to a new [[Basics/Time/round]], such as by resting or traveling, any real-world timers end.

A **scene** is a period of minutes in the game world that corresponds to a significant event, activity, or exchange.  In many cases, this is equivalent to an **encounter** with a monster or NPC.

The most common scenes are:

* A combat, composed of several [[combat round|combat rounds]]
* A conversation, discussion, or interrogation, which might include a few [[round|rounds]] of questioning and answering
* Carefully exploring a single dungeon room or location, with might be only one or a few [[round|rounds]] of exploration tasks

### duration

Some effects end with the current scene.  This generally corresponds to the end of exploring a single location (such as room) or the end of a combat (when the party is catching their breaths, ensuring everyone is okay, and confirming that there are no more incoming threats).

### scene transitions

A scene transition is not always clear.  Perhaps a conversational encounter devolves into a combat, or a combat devolves into a chase. Perhaps the characters traverse a bridge from one numbered location on the map to another, triggering an encounter at the far side of the bridge while some characters are still on the near side.

If there is a scene-long effect--such as an ongoing spell--in play during an unclear scene transition, the GM can:

* declare a scene transition (thus ending any scene-based effects)
* allow the scene effect to carry over into the new scene
* call for a [[Cast|spellcasting]] roll (S or F only) to maintain the effect

### casting time

Some spells have a casting time of one scene.  Other characters can engage in other activities or tasks during this time.

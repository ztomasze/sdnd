A **scene** is a period of minutes in the game world that corresponds to a significant event.  In many cases, this is equivalent to an **encounter** with a monster or NPC.

The most common scenes are:

* A combat, composed of several [[combat round|combat rounds]]
* A conversation, discussion, or interrogation, which might include a few [[round|rounds]] of questioning and answering
* Carefully exploring a single dungeon room or location, perhaps consisting of only a single  [[Basics/Time/round|exploration round]]

### casting time

Some spells have a casting time of one scene.  Other characters can do other activities during this time.

### scene transitions

A scene transition is not always clear.  Perhaps a conversational encounter devolves into a combat, or a combat devolves into a chase. Perhaps the characters traverse a bridge from one numbered location on the map to another, triggering an encounter at the far side of the bridge while some characters are still on the near side.

If there is a scene-long effect--such as an ongoing spell--in play during an unclear scene transition, the GM can:

* still declare a scene transition (thus ending any scene-based effects)
* allow the scene effect to carry over into the new scene
* call for a [[Cast|spellcasting]] roll (S or F only) to maintain the effect

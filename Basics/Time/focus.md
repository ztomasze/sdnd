A **focus** spell or effect requires your ongoing mental attention.  It ends either with the end of the current [[scene]] or as soon as your attention is interrupted.

- While you focus, you can't cast another focus spell. You can end your focus at any time.
- If you are damaged, significantly jostled, or similarly distracted while focusing, you must immediately make a focus roll to maintain your focus.

### focus roll

This is equivalent to a [[Cast#spellcasting roll|spellcasting roll]], but:

- **S:** The spell effect continues.
- **F:** The spell ends.
	- **CF:** The spell is also exhausted.

### focus per turn

For effects with this duration, you must make a focus roll at the start of each of your turns to maintain the spell. (The [[Concentrate]] action can help you here.)

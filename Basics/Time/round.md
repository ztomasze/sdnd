Each **round**, the GM checks in on what each player character is doing and makes sure everyone gets a turn (if they want one).  

How much time that round corresponds to in the game world can vary:

| Round type                                | Approx. duration in the game world  |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| (wipe or jump)                            | Jump to a later point in time       |
| **Traveling round** or **Downtime round** | Hours or Days                       |
| **Exploring round** or **[[scene]]**      | Minutes - Typically 1 to 10 minutes |
| **Combat round** or <br>**Tense round**   | Seconds - Typically 6 to 10 seconds |

Any effect that lasts for a given number of unqualified **rounds** typically means a [[combat round]]. That same time frame can be used for other tense non-combat moments, such as during conversations or as a sinking ship fills with water.

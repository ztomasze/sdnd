Each **round**, the GM checks in on what each player character is doing and makes sure everyone gets a turn (if they want one).Â  

How much time that round corresponds to in the game world can vary:

| Game world duration | Sample activity                             | Maximum effect duration                                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Seconds**         | Combat, problem solving under time pressure | About 6 to 10 seconds /  <br>one [[combat round]]       |
| **Minutes**         | Exploring, conversation                     | Up to 10 minutes /  <br>one [[scene]]                   |
| **Hours**           | Traveling, resting, town activites          | Up to 10 hours or so / <br>the active part of a [[day]] |
| **Days**            | Downtime                                    | Some number of [[downtime]] days                        |
| **(jump or wipe)**  | Skips over time of any duration             | --                                                      |

Any effect that lasts for a given number of unqualified **rounds** typically means a [[combat round]].

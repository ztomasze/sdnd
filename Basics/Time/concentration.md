A **concentration** spell or effect requires your ongoing mental attention.  It ends either with the end of the current [[scene]] or as soon as your attention is interrupted.

- While you concentrate on a spell, you can't cast another concentration spell. 
- You can end your concentration at any time.
- If you are damaged, significantly jostled, or similarly distracted while concentrating, you must immediately make a concentration save to maintain your concentration.

### concentration save

Make a Fortitude [[save]] with the corresponding effect on your spell:

- **S:** The spell effect continues.
- **F:** The spell ends.
	- **CF:** The spell is also exhausted.

There are three options for adjudicating distances in SD&D:

1. **5-foot increments** (best for play on a gridded map; *default*)
2. **Descriptors** (best for a non-gridded map)
3. **Theater of the mind** (no map is used) 

#### 5-foot increments

This is the default option. Distances, weapon ranges, and areas of effect are given in 5-foot increments.  

A square grid of 5' squares works best. A Small or Medium creatures each occupies 1 square in combat.

When measuring distance, each square counts as 5' of distance, whether moving laterally or diagonally. Figures can move diagonally around trees and other figures but not around wall corners or other objects that completely fill their space (square).

>**GM Tip: Fuzzy range edges on a grid**  
>Even when using a grid, the goal is to have battles feel fast, chaotic, and dramatic, rather than like a carefully planned chess match. As a character in the heat of battle, you don't know exactly how far that orc can sprint in the next few seconds or just how hard he can pull back his bow. While using a map grid can help players determine for themselves what their character can see, run to, or shoot this round, it can also lead to an assumption of certainty on those distances.
>
>In that case, you can use this rule:  If a creature wants to run 5 or 10 feet farther than their speed would normally allow over level ground, they can make an Easy or Normal DEX(Athletics) [[check]], respectively, as part of their move to do so. This is not without some risk, though. A CF on the check means they stumble (gain a bane) on a Normal check or trip and fall prone partway there on a Hard check. 
>
>Similarly, you can throw or shoot a [[weapons|weapon]] beyond its normal range at +1 to the AC of the target for each 5' beyond the normal range.  (If this is more than 10 or 15 feet, then it's better to accept the disadvantage of a second range increment.)

##### areas

Align all areas to the grids as squares, cubes, or rectanguloids, even if they are narratively circles and spheres.  This helps lessen the impact of simplifying diagonal movement to being equivalent to lateral movement.

### descriptors

The GM describes or adjudicate distances primarily in terms of **adjacent**, **near**, or **far**.  However, some intermediate distance categories are often useful for particular effects or situations:

| Distance     | Abbr. | Approx.    | Description / Uses                                                                                                          | Conversion range |
| ------------ | ----- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| personal     | P     | 0' - 1'    | In your space and typically in full contact; wrestling or hugging distance.                                                 | < 3'             |
| **adjacent** | A     | 5'         | Close enough to reach out and touch.  Melee attack range; touch spell; candlelight.                                         | 5'               |
| close        | C     | 10' to 15' | How far you can move in one action over difficult terrain; candlelight + dimsight. "Half near"                              | 10' or 15'       |
| **near**     | N     | 30'        | How far you can usually move with one action; range of most thrown weapons; torchlight                                      | 20' to 40'       |
| midrange     | M     | 60'        | Farthest you can move in a turn if you dash; lantern light or torch + dimsight. "Double near"                               | 50' to 80'       |
| **far**      | F     | 120'+      | How far you can shoot a ranged weapon; lantern light + dimsight; typically the full extent of vision underground or indoors | 100' to 200'     |
| distant      | D     | *          | Still in range of artillery, arching army bow shots, etc.                                                                   |                  |
| sight        | S     | *          | Beyond weapon range but still visible when outdoors.                                                                        |                  |
When converting from other sources, 45' and 90' can be rounded up or down based on the context (up by default).

##### areas

Area sizes are typically stated with a "-radius" postfix, such as "a near-radius area".

| Size         | Defintion                                                                                            | <div style="width: 5em;">Radius</div> | <div style="width: 5em;">Diameter</div> |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **personal** | The **space** occupied or controlled by a typical medium-sized creature with their arms outstretched | (personal)<br>(< 5')                  | (adjacent)<br>(5')                      |
| **adjacent** | A creature's **space +** everything **adjacent** to it                                               | adjacent<br>(5')                      | close<br>(15')                          |
| **close**    | A creature's **space +** everything **close** to it                                                  | close<br>(15')                        | near<br>(35')                           |
| **near**     | A creature's **space +** everything **near** to it                                                   | near<br>(30')                         | midrange<br>(65')                       |
| **medium**   | A creature's **space +** everything **midrange** of it                                               | midrange<br>(60')                     | far<br>(125')                           |
| **far**      | A creature's space + everything **far** from it                                                      | far<br>(120')                         | distant<br>(245')                       |


> **Design: Descriptor-based distance categories**  
> Early editions of SD&D favored this approach and used only these descriptors for all distances, ranges, areas, and speeds. While the goal was simplicity, several practical complexities arose. For example:
> 
> - New players have to learn the new distance vocabulary.  
> - Areas were somewhat convoluted to specify, such as an close-radius burst, which has a near diameter  
> - Some monsters move faster or slower than a normal near-distance speed. Speeds specified as close, near, or midrange felt odd, but it didn’t feel much simpler to add another set of descriptors for speed that then needed to be mentally mapped to the distance descriptors.  
> - In certain cases, any conversion from other sources loses subtly. For example, in some editions of the source game, zombies move at 20’ per move while most characters move at 30’. While it is fine to translate both of these to a near-distance move in most cases, it would be nice to track that zombies are still slower overall. This would be relevant in a chase or perhaps in a Dash situation where a zombie would still only cover a near distance (and so effectively can’t double Move in a turn). While speeds could be broken down into substeps, such as near-, near, and near+, this strays ever further from simplicity.  
> - SD&D aims to support on-the-fly conversion from different editions of the source game. This conversion is often simpler to convert to feet, especially when it comes to spell area effects, as they are already described in those terms.  
> 
 > In conclusion, support for distance descriptors remains a design goal. SD&D numerical distances all correspond to one of the descriptor categories. However, for greater clarity and support for other styles of play, those distances are stated using numerical distances. 

### theater of the mind

In this case, no map is used.  The GM can use either of the methods above to adjudicate distances. Alternatively, they might use another system of their preference (such as a zones).

The GM will describe or adjudicate distances primarily in terms of **adjacent**, **near**, or **far**.Â 

However, some intermediate distance categories are often useful for particular effects or situations:

| Distance     | Abbr. | Approx.    | Description / Uses                                                                                                          |
| ------------ | ----- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| personal     | P     | 0' - 1'    | In your space and typically in full contact; wrestling distance.                                                            |
| **adjacent** | A     | 5'         | Close enough to reach out and touch.  Melee attack range; touch spell; candlelight.                                         |
| close        | C     | 10' to 15' | How far you can move in one action over difficult terrain; candlelight + dimsight. "Half near"                              |
| **near**     | N     | 30'        | How far you can usually move with one action; range of most thrown weapons; torchlight                                      |
| midrange     | M     | 60'        | Farthest you can move in a turn if you dash; lantern light or torch + dimsight. "Double near"                               |
| **far**      | F     | 120'+      | How far you can shoot a ranged weapon; lantern light + dimsight; typically the full extent of vision underground or indoors |
| distant      | D     | *          | Still in range of artillery, arching army bow shots, etc.                                                                   |
| sight        | S     | *          | Beyond weapon range but still visible when outdoors.                                                                        |


> **Design: Distance categories**  
> The default mode for SD&D is to play with a gridless map.  This can be as lightweight as a few chess pieces or tokens pilfered from another game placed on the table in front of you, just to show the relative position of different characters and monsters. The GM then adjudicates the distances as necessary based on the categories above.
> 
> However, the game also aims to support gridded maps or a full theater-of-the-mind approach. 
> 
> If playing with a gridded map, each hex or square should represent 5 feet. If playing on squares, simply count squares directly, even when moving diagonally. Treat all [[areas]] as big squares or cubes.

>**GM Tip: Fuzzy range edges**  
>The goal is to have battles feel fast, chaotic, and dramatic, rather than like a carefully planned chess match. As a character in the heat of battle, you don't know exactly how far that orc can sprint in the next few seconds or just how hard he can pull back his bow.  While using a map grid can help players determine for themselves what their character can see, run to, or shoot this round, it can also lead to an assumption of certainty on those distances.
>
>In that case, you can use this rule:  If a creature wants to run 5 or 10 feet farther than their speed would normally allow over level ground, they can make an Easy or Normal DEX(Athletics) [[check]], respectively, as part of their move to do so. This is not without some risk, though. A CF on the check means they stumble (gain a bane) or even trip and fall prone partway there. 
>
>Similarly, you can throw or shoot a [[weapons|weapon]] beyond its normal range at +1 to the AC of the target for each 5' beyond the normal range.  (If this is more than 10 or 15 feet, then it's better to accept the disadvantage of a second range increment.)

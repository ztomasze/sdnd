Spells, light sources, and other effects affect a region or **area** of a given size.  

Unless the effect would only affect the ground (such as oil, caltrops, grease, or spiky growths), assume that the "area" is actually a volume, such as a cube, sphere, or hemisphere, as is most appropriate.  

The default area of effect is a **cube**. The cube should always align with any grid used.

Some effects have more constrained shapes.

### radius

Whenever a **radius** is given, it should be tactically mapped as a cube with that distance measured from the central square to an edge. (Narratively, it may still be circular or spherical in the game world.)  For example, a torch illuminates a 30' radius. This produces a 65' cube of illumination centered on the creature or square (space) that holds the torch.

* Large or Gargantuan creatures occupy an area of 4 or 16 squares centered on an intersection point. If a radius effect is centered on them, the radius is measured from the central 4 squares of the creature's space. This will produce a slightly larger area (such as a 70' cube of torch illumination) than for a Medium or smaller creature.
* Most of the time, the ground interrupts the cube, producing something closer to an angular hemisphere.  For example, a torch illuminates a ceiling up to 30' above the character holding it. If standing on the edge of a cliff, it would also illuminate 30' below them.

### aura

An **aura** is an area of effect centered on a creature, object, or space that then moves with that creature, object, or space.

### cone

The effect extends from the caster in a widening cone. Draw a midpoint line from the center of the source square (such as the caster's) to the center square of the wide end. The source square is not included in the effect. At any point along the cone, its width is equal to the distance from the source. 

For example, a caster casts *burning hands*, which produces a 15' cone of fire. 5' (one square) away, the cone is 5' wide.  10' (two squares) away, the cone is 10' wide. 15' (three squares) away, the cone is 15' wide.

When aligning with a square grid, the midpoint line of the cone can be aligned horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

* When vertical or horizontal, each row of even squares of effect can be nudged half a square orthogonally to align with the grid. All even rows must be nudged in the same direction.
* When diagonal, the cone forms an equilateral triangle of squares. The 90-degree angle can be placed at the caster, producing a shorter wider cone: Every odd row of the cone is centered on a square on the midline while every even row is centered on a vertex on the midline. Alternatively, a 45 degree angle can be placed at the caster to produce the full length of the cone along the diagonal and the rest of its effect either above or below that line.

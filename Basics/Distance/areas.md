Spells, light sources, and other effects affect a region or **area** of a given size.  

The size of these areas is defined in terms of SD&D [[distance|distances]].  This is typically stated with a "-radius" postfix, such as "a near-radius area".

| Size         | Defintion                                                                                            | <div style="width: 5em;">Radius</div> | <div style="width: 5em;">Diameter</div> |

Unless the effect would only affect the ground (such as oil, caltrops, grease, or spiky growths), assume that the area is actually a cube (or sphere or hemisphere if that is more appropriate).  If playing on a square grid, default to cuboid or rectanguloid shapes.

Some effects have more constrained shapes:

### aura

An **aura** is a an area of effect centered on a creature, object, or point that moves with that creature, object, or point.

### cone

The effect extends from the caster in a widening cone. At any point along the cone, its width is equal to the distance from the caster.  Widest part of the cone is at the end of the range. This produces an angle of less than 60 degrees originating from the caster. Only a single adjacent target can be affected by a cone.

### swath

The effect is a line of spaces and those spaces adjacent to that line.  On a grid, this would be a rectanguloid 15' wide, 15' tall, and extending from the caster to the end of the range.

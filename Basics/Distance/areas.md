Spells, light sources, and other effects affect a region, **area**, or volume of a given size.  

Areas or volumes align to the grid as squares, cubes, or rectanguloids, even if they narratively still represent circles, spheres, and clouds. This avoids the adjudication of partially-covered squares, and it helps to lessen the impact of simplifying diagonal movement to being equivalent to lateral movement.

The following keywords are used to describe the area or volume of different effects.

* If an area or volume effect is described as **adjacent**, at least some part of it must be placed in a square adjacent to the caster.  On a grid, it will share at least one edge or corner with the caster's square (space).  Depending on the size of the effect, it may then extend beyond the squares that are adjacent to the caster.

### area

If an effect only affects the ground (such as oil, caltrops, grease, or spiky growths), it is described as an **area**. The length of each side of this area is equal to the [[distance]] given.

### cube

Most "area effects" are actually volumes. The simplest volume shape is a **cube**. The length of each side of the cube is equal to the distance (length) given. The cube rests on the ground. 

For example, a 5' cube fills one square of the map grid. A 15' cube is 15' feet (3 squares) to a side and extends 15' above the ground.

### radius

When a **radius** is given, it defines a larger cube formed around a central square or space. The given distance is measured from the central square to the square's edge. The central space in included in the effect.

For example, a torch illuminates a 30' radius. This produces a 65' cube of illumination centered on the creature or square (space) that holds the torch.

* Most of the time, the ground interrupts a radius cube, producing something closer to an angular hemisphere.  For example, a torch illuminates a ceiling up to 30' above the character holding it. If standing on the edge of a cliff, it would also illuminate 30' below them.

### aura

An **aura** is a radius effect centered on a creature, object, or space that then moves with that creature, object, or space.

* [[light source|Light sources]] become auras of illumination when carried by a creature.
* Large or Gargantuan creatures occupy an area of 4 or 16 squares centered on an intersection point. If an aura effect is centered on them, the radius is measured from the central 4 squares of the creature's space. This will produce a slightly larger area (such as a 70' cube of torch illumination) than for a Medium or smaller creature.

### volume

A custom or more complicated shape, with a description and dimensions given.  The **volume** keyword is not always used explicitly in this case.

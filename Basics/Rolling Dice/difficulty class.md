Most impromptu [[check|checks]] are either Hard or Normal or (occasionally) Easy.Â  Other difficulty levels are possible, though:

| DC  | Difficulty        | Notes                                                                                                                                                             |
| --- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 30  | Nearly Impossible | Minimal chance (nat 20) at the peak of human ability (+4 mod, +6 expertise).  <br>Any higher is impossible (don't roll)                                           |
| 25  | Extremely Hard    | Impossible without expertise, even with maximum natural ability (+4).  <br>Very Hard for someone at the peak of human ability.                                    |
| 20  | Very Hard         | Minimal chance (nat 20) of someone without training or ability achieving this (+0).  <br>Yet close to Normal difficulty for someone at the peak of human ability. |
| 15  | **Hard**          | 30% chance of success when rolling at +0.  <br>Equivalent to Normal DC if you have +4 [[abilities\|ability]] mod or +4 expertise.                                 |
| 13  | *Somewhat Hard*   |                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 11  | **Normal**        | 50% chance of success when rolling at +0.                                                                                                                         |
| 9   | *Somewhat Easy*   |                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 7   | **Easy**          | 30% chance of failure when rolling at +0.  <br>Equivalent to Normal DC if you have -4 ability mod and no expertise.                                               |
| 2   | Very Easy         | Minimal chance of failure (nat 1) without modifiers (+0).  <br>Any positive ability or expertise guarantees success.                                              |

Circumstantial modifiers might adjust the typical DC, such as [[Attack#cover|cover]] improving a target's AC.

### default DC

If a specific DC is not given for a check defined in the SD&D rules, assume it is of Normal difficulty.


> **Design: Swapable DCs**  
> DCs levels are often a matter of strong opinion, and other games in this genre follow different conventions here. For the most commonly used S&D DCs of Hard, Normal, and Easy:
> 
> - SD&D uses DC 15, DC 11, DC 7.  
> - D&D 5e and 3e uses DC 15, DC 10, DC 5 (although by different names).  
> - Shadowdark uses DC 15, DC 12, DC 9.  
> - A 10-centered variant of SD&D could be DC 14, DC 10, DC 6.  
> 
> However, each of these variants is within 1 (5%) of the Hard and Normal DCs that are most commonly used in SD&D. SD&D rules use the name of the DC, rather than the numerical value. This gives you greater freedom to swap out these DC values if you have a strong preference otherwise or because you're running an adventure module from a similar system and don't want to do constant mental conversion.
> 
> The scaling DCs of 10+X--where X might be spell tier, armor, or monster HD--are more commonly used across these different systems and so should generally be used as given here.

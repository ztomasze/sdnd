Most impromptu [[check|tasks]] are either Hard or Normal or (occasionally) Easy.Â  Other options are possible, though:

| DC  | Difficulty    | Notes                                                                                                |
| --- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 17  | Very hard     |                                                                                                      |
| 15  | **Hard**      | 30% chance of success at +0  <br>Equivalent to Normal DC if you have -4 [[abilities\|ability]] mod   |
| 13  | Somewhat hard |                                                                                                      |
| 11  | **Normal**    | 50% chance of success at +0  <br>If no DC is given, assume it is 11.                                 |
| 9   | Somewhat easy |                                                                                                      |
| 7   | **Easy**      | 30% chance of failure at +0  <br>Equivalent to Normal DC if you have a +4 [[abilities\|ability]] mod |
| 5   | Very easy     |                                                                                                      |

Circumstantial modifiers might adjust the typical DC, such as [[cover]] improving a target's AC.

If a specific DC is not given for a check defined in the SD&D rules, assume it is of Normal difficulty.


> **Design: Flexible default DCs**  
> Default DCs are often a matter of strong opinion, and other games in this genre follow different conventions here. For the most commonly used S&D DCs of Hard, Normal, and Easy:
> 
> SD&D uses DC 15, DC 11, DC 7.  
> D&D 5e and 3e uses DC 15, DC 10, DC 5 (although by different names).  
> Shadowdark uses DC 15, DC 12, DC 9.  
> A 10-based variant of SD&D would be DC 14, DC 10, DC 6.  
> 
> However, each of these variants is within 1 (5%) of the Hard and Normal DCs most commonly used in SD&D. These rules use the name of the DC, rather than the numerical value. This gives you greater freedom to swap out the default DCs if you have a strong preference otherwise or because you're running an adventure module from a similar system and don't want to do constant mental conversion.
> 
> The scaling DCs of 10+X--where X might be spell tier, armor, or monster HD--are more commonly used across these different systems and so should generally be used as given here.

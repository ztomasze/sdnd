In a **contest**, each side makes a relevant [[check|roll]] and the higher result wins.Â 

- In the case of a tie, the present state continues. Or roll again if a tie doesn't make sense.  
- Monsters should generally substitute a static 10 + modifier for their roll in order to speed play.  This modifier is often their HD.

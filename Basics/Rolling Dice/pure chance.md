Sometimes the outcome of a task is more a matter of chance than any skill or training.  In this case, instead of a [[check|check]], a GM might call for an unmodified roll of a d6, d20, or d100 to determine the outcome. 

- X-in-6 means roll a d6 and the result happens on a result of X or lower.
- d20 chance roll is often informally called a **luck roll** (not to confused with [[luck]]).

A **save** is a special [[check|check]] triggered by another’s action or by an ongoing effect, rather than as part of a proactive action of your own.  Succeeding on a save reduces or negates a negative consequence, such as contracting a disease, getting burned by a burst of flame, falling into a pit trap, or being charmed by a mischievous faerie.

There are three saves:

| Save          | Base Ability | Use                                                                  | Abbr.   |
| ------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| **Fortitude** | **CON**      | To resist physical punishment and attacks on your vitality or health | F, Fort |
| **Reflex**    | **DEX**      | To dodge area effects and other attacks that would bypass your armor | R, Ref  |
| **Will**      | **WIS**      | To resist attacks on your mind                                       | W, Will |

When rolling a save, roll an [[check|ability check]] of the corresponding ability:

* The DC is always Hard (15)
* A natural 20 always succeeds, and a natural 1 always fails.
* Your save is affected by any circumstantial bonus or penalty, advantage or disadvantage, to the base ability of that save.
* The [[Improved Save]] feat can let you add a secondary ability modifier to one of your saves.  (This provides a static bonus; it does not confer any circumstantial effects from that secondary ability.)
* Certain items or effects might grant you a bonus to one or more saves (which does not apply to other ability checks).

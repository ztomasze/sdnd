A **save** is a special [[check|check]] triggered by another’s action or by an ongoing effect, rather than as part of a proactive action of your own.  Succeeding on a save reduces or negates a negative consequence, such as getting burned by a burst of flame, contracting a disease, falling into a pit trap, or being charmed by a mischievous faerie.

There are three saves:

* **Fortitude (CON)** - To resist physical punishment and attacks on your vitality or health.
* **Reflex (DEX)** - To dodge area effects and other attacks that would bypass our armor.
* **Will (WIS)** - To resist attacks on your mind.

When rolling a save, roll an ability check of the corresponding ability:

* The DC is always Hard (15)
* A natural 20 always succeeds, and a natural 1 always fails.
* The Improved Save [[feats|feat]] can let you add an additional ability modifier to one of your saves.

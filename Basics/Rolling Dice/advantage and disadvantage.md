  - advantage

If you have **advantage**, [[check|roll]] two dice and take the higher result. With **disadvantage**, take the lower.

- Having an advantage cancels out one disadvantage and vice versa.    
- Having more than one advantage or more than one disadvantage has no benefit: You don't roll more than 2 dice.

If rolling a pool of dice with advantage--such as a damage roll or HD roll--roll double the size of the pool and drop the lower half.

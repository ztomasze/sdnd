A **check** is the most common way to resolve a [[task]] whose outcome is uncertain.   This might also be called a **roll** or **test**.

To resolve a check, roll d20 + relevant [[abilities|ability]] modifier >= [[difficulty class]] (DC).

- The GM determines the relevant [[abilities|ability]] to use based on the nature of the task. 
- Rolls are not needed for simple tasks or logical outcomes, but only when there is some risk, pressure, or question as to the likely result.
- Attacks are a common kind of check. When making an [[attack]] roll, the DC equals the armor class (AC) of the target.

### degree of success

There are four **degrees of success (DoS)** possible on a check:

- **S:** A roll result that is >= the DC is a **success**
	- **CS:** A natural 20 on the die for a roll that is also a success is a **critical success**.  A critical success means you performed particularly well on the task.
- **F:** A roll result that is < the DC is a **failure**
	- **CF:** A natural 1 on the die for a roll that is also a failure is a **critical failure**.  A critical failure opens you up to the whims of the GM to potentially impose a mishap or consequence for such a bad failure.

A CS or CF doesn't always need to result in a special outcome beyond a normal S or F, but several specific rules make use of them.Â  See [[attack|attacks]], [[Cast|spellcasting]], and [[Move#climbing and swimming]] as examples.

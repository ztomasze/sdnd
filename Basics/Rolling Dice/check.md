To succeed at a task, roll d20 + relevant [[abilities|ability]] modifier >= [[difficulty class]] (DC)

- This might be called a **check**, **roll**, **test**, or **task**.
- The GM determines the relevant [[abilities|ability]] to use based on the nature of the task. 
- Rolls are not needed for simple tasks or logical outcomes, but only when there is some risk, pressure, or question as to the likely result.

When making an [[attack]] roll, the DC equals the armor class (AC) of the target.

### degree of success

There are four **degrees of success (DoS)** possible on a check:

- A roll result that is >= the DC is a **success (S)**
- A roll result that is < the DC is a **failure (F)**
- A natural 20 on the die for a roll that is also a success is a **critical success (CS)**.  A critical success means you performed particularly well on the task.
- A natural 1 on the die for a roll that is also a failure is a **critical failure (CF)**.  A critical failure opens you up to the whims of the GM to potentially impose a mishap or consequence for such a bad failure.

A CS or CF doesn't always need to result in a special outcome beyond a normal S or F, but several specific rules make use of them.Â  See [[attack|attacks]], [[Cast|spellcasting]], and climbing as examples.

A **task** (also called a **challenge**) is any time a character attempts a noteworthy action in the game world.

The GM determines and narrates the outcome.  This can be:

* Yes / Automatic - no roll needed
* No / Impossible - no roll needed
* Maybe - Let the dice decide, either with a [[check]] or [[pure chance]]

Primal magic taps into the flow of nature and the raw elemental energies of the inner planes.

### no metal armor

You cannot cast a primal spell while wearing metal armor.

This limitation does not apply if you gained access to the spell through other means than the Primal spell list, such as in the case of the [[thaumaturge]] or [[theurge]].

### mishap

Your spiritual connection to the natural world wavers. The spell slot of the spell you just tried to cast is now **inaccessible** to you. 

To recover it, you must contemplate and commune with nature in a sufficiently wild natural area for 1 day per spell tier.Â  If this contemplation is also done in the presence of an ancient Druidic standing stone or stone circle, you can halve this time.

You cannot [[spells known|replace a spell]] with another one while it is inaccessible.

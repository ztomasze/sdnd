The different spellcasting classes adhere to different magical traditions.

Your magic tradition:

* Determines the source and general flavor of your magic
* May impose some limitations on how you cast spells
* Has its own **mishap** when you critically fail a spellcasting roll

The major traditions are:

* [[arcane]]
* [[divine]]
* [[primal]]

Other minor traditions exist in the world (as represented by the [[theurge]]), and some casters are able to cross between (or pilfer from!) other traditions (as represented by the [[thaumaturge]]).

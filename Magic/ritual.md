> A [[Cast#modifiers|spellcasting modifier]]

A **ritual** spell can be cast slowly and carefully so as not to expend a spell slot.

Instead of [[Cast|casting]] as as normal, you can spend a [[scene]] to cast a ritual spell.  When cast this way, no spellcasting roll is needed and the spell slot is not expended.

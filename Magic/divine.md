Divine magic is channeled from the gods or similar otherworldly patrons, planes, or ideals.

### battle caster

If you prominently display your holy symbol--such as as a pendant on your chest or as an engraving on your shield--you do not need a [[Cast#verbal and somatic components|free hand]] to cast spells.  If you have a bludgeoning weapon in one hand, you can use it to deliver touch spells.

### mishap

Your divine connection with your divine source wavers. Perhaps the deity is displeased, or perhaps you have simply been pulled too far from the divine into the mundane affairs of the world. The spell you just tried to cast is now **inaccessible** to you.

You can restore it through atonement, worship, penance, and/or sacrifice.  Depending on your deity, this might require a period of incense-fueled prayer, donations to charity, sacrifice of livestock, or other endeavors.  

Practically, this maps to a day spent and the loss of a certain amount of wealth:

| Spell Tier | Cost (gp) |
| ---------- | --------- |
| 1          | 5         |
| 2          | 20        |
| 3          | 40        |
| 4          | 90        |
| 5          | 150       |

You cannot [[spells known|replace a spell]] with another one while it is inaccessible.

> A [[Cast#modifiers|spellcasting modifier]]

A **rote** spell is so well practiced that it is not easily lost from your memory and its magic never goes awry.

When [[Cast#spellcasting roll|casting]] a rote spell:

- **F:** No effect is produced, but the slot is not exhausted.
	- **CF:** The spell is exhausted, but you suffer no mishap.

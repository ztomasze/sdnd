Spells come in five **tiers**, plus [[cantrip|cantrips]].

A spellcaster knows (holds in their mind) a number of spells depending on their level:

| Level  | Cantrips | Tier 1 | Tier 2 | Tier 3 | Tier 4 | Tier 5 |
| ------ | -------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| **1**  | 4        | 3      | -      | -      | -      | -      |
| **2**  | 4        | 4      | -      | -      | -      | -      |
| **3**  | 4        | 4      | 2      | -      | -      | -      |
| **4**  | 5        | 4      | 3      | -      | -      | -      |
| **5**  | 5        | 4      | 3      | 2      | -      | -      |
| **6**  | 5        | 4      | 4      | 2      | -      | -      |
| **7**  | 5        | 4      | 4      | 3      | 1      | -      |
| **8**  | 6        | 4      | 4      | 3      | 2      | -      |
| **9**  | 6        | 4      | 4      | 3      | 3      | 1      |
| **10** | 6        | 4      | 4      | 3      | 3      | 2      |
You can replace any spell choice with a spell of a lower tier from your class spell list.

### prepared spells

A [[cleric]], [[druid]], or [[wizard]] **prepares** their spells (except for [[cantrip|cantrips]]). At the end of each long rest, they can choose to replace any spells known with a different spell of the same (or lower) tier that is available to them. 

Clerics and druids can prepare any spell from their full spell list. Wizards can prepare any spell from their spell book.

### learned

All other spellcasters **learn** their spells. This means their set of spells known is fairly permanent.

Any spellcaster can replace one learned spell with another valid choice when they level up. This includes cantrips, but it does not include any spells gained through your [[ancestry]].

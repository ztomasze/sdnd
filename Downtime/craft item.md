### mundane item

To craft a mundane item, you need:

* an appropriate [[intelligence|craft]] or [[intelligence|profession]] expertise
* the necessary tools
* an appropriate place to work (forge, laboratory, etc)

Expend half the market value of the item for raw materials.  You then spend 1 day of downtime for every 5 gp in the item's value to produce it. You can produce multiple small items collectively worth up to 5 gp in one day. 

If the item is large enough or has component parts that would allow for collaboration, multiple characters that all meet the requirements above can each contribute 5 gp of progress per day.

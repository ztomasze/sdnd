Downtime generally occurs between adventures. It can also happen as part of travel, such as several days spent on a ship passage.

First, **determine the number of downtime days available**.  This may be constrained by the narrative, such as the duration of the passage or waiting until the next story event (scheduled council meeting, planetary conjunction, arrival of the elven delegation, etc).  Or the players might decide themselves how long they'd like to spend.

Each **downtime day costs a character 1 gp per day** to cover living expenses. Some downtime activities have additional costs or can waive this standard living expense. There may be other narrative reasons you can waive this expense.

**Determine available resources and facilities.** As players choose their character's downtime activities, confirm with the GM that that activity is currently possible.  For example, you cannot do any blacksmithing on a sailing ship or research ancient lore without any books.

While most downtime activities can be pursued individually, some are group activities.

**Downtime activities** include:

| Activity         | Description                                    | Days | Cost                    |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---- | ----------------------- |
| [[carouse]]      | Convert gold to XP through raucous celebration | 1+   | 15+ gp per participant  |
| [[gain a level]] | Spend XP to increase one class level.          | 1    | (10 x current level) XP |
| [[recover luck]] | Recover your expended luck points.             | 1    | 1 XP or 10 gp           |

### Trading

Trying to buy or sell rare, magical, or expensive items; arranging large purchases (such as purchasing, building, or upgrading a ship, castle, or stronghold), or hiring and training trustworthy hirelings. 

### Work
Spending your time to earn money. Typically done for material wealth, but might also be for renown, favors, social ties, divine boons, etc.  Or you may just need to put in occasional time to maintain the status/benefits you already enjoy (such as if you're part of a guild, cult, or other org). 

if working for money, determine if have you proficiency and if you have access to the facilities or environment needed to perform your profession. For example, you can not do blacksmithing while on a long sea voyage.  If you satisfy this prereqs, ignore living costs. (for guild, cult, etc, that's what you get)

proficiency roll for the time (days) that you spend working:
* CF: Complication
* Easy+: Make 1 gp per day
* Normal+: Make 2 gp per day
* Hard+: Make 5 gp per day
* CS: Windfall: 10 gp per day

You might also work at unconventional tasks.  Most of these will require a roll:
running a business, crime, gambling, performing, pit fighting, etc.

religious service

Reknown: DC 10+current reknown: +1
reknown x days of work to attempt another roll.
Example: You currently have 3 reknown. after accumulating 3 days of working to improve your reknown, make a luck roll DC13. On a success, your reknown increases to 4.

To carouse, you need a tavern, or at least a steady source of libations and a large festive crowd.  Over drinks, you sing songs, bond with your party, and recount tales of your adventures.

**Participants:** Determine which party members will be participating.

**Cost:**  To start carousing, spend 15 gp x intensity x number of participants. Choose your intensity modifier as a group.

**Rolls:** Each participant makes a CHA roll:
* Total the results as your carousing points. Multiply by the intensity.
* For each natural 1, you gain a Complication.
* For each natural 20, gain 20 carousing points and then roll again.

**Bender:** If two or more participants roll the same natural value on their carousing roll, the party continues into the next day. All participants must spend another downtime day.  If you cannot spend another downtime day, the carousing ends.  No additional cost is necessary as bystanders join your revelry and start paying for drinks.  Make another round of carousing rolls, adding to your total.

**Morning after:** At the end of the carousing, every 10 carousing points accumulated become 1 XP.  Divide this XP evenly between participants. For any extra points of XP, each participant can roll a luck roll, with those rolling highest each claiming one of the extra XP.  Then resolve any complications.

**Complications:**  Roll for each complication earned. Only the participant who rolled a 1 is affect, but other participants can contribute funds on their behalf.
